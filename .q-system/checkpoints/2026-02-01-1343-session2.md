## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Lead with positive opportunity, not controversy | User wants upbeat opening; save JCIM vs ACIM issues for Chapter 3 |
| Remove personal author focus | Study guide lets texts speak for themselves; authority comes from synthesis quality |
| Add fourth audience (newcomers) | Broadens appeal, forces writing to assume nothing |
| Keep Chapter 1 at ~1,200 words | Acceptable for introduction; heavier chapters come in Part 2 |
| Chapter 1 complete | User approved; ready to move on |
