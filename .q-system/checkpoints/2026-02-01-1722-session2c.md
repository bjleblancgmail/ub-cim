5. **Simultaneous Discovery** — No one finds until all find (with parallel paths note)
6. **Each Adds One More Degree** — Our contribution to the whole
7. **Returning Home** — The ancient song, universe home
8. **Closing — When Time Ends** — Individual fusion mirrors collective fusion

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Simplified "missing parts" language in Section 2 | Avoid implying no one awakens until everyone does |
| Added parallel paths (individual/collective) in Section 5 | User clarified: individual fusion is parallel to collective completion |
| Added fusion parallel in closing | Supreme fuses (spirit + power) just as individual fuses (mortal + Adjuster) |
| Kept chapter focused on collective, referenced Ch 6 for individual | Avoid redundancy, trust prior chapter |
