| Found real UB 111:6.8 quote for Ch 9 | Replaced fabricated quote |
| Added "Holy Spirit was also mine" to Ch 10 | Strengthens bridge concept |
| Corrected 112:7.8 in Ch 10 | Accuracy - used actual quote |

## Author Note Added to Profile

> For me this is a theoretical exercise. I have not attained these lofty goals. But first comes theory, then practice. First you need a goal to aim for. I hope this book inspires a community to explore this moon shot — taking humanity to another level of awareness.

## Current Status When Compacting

- Was about to start Chapter 12: Forgiveness - Mercy vs Love
- Had pulled source material on forgiveness quotes
- Key quotes found:
  - UB 188:5.2: "The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin."
  - Pardon vs forgiveness distinction
  - Forgiveness of love doesn't see sin but sees lack of love
