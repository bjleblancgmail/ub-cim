## Key Accomplishments

### Chapter 7 Edits
1. **Section 2:** Revised paragraph about "the Son" to acknowledge the Course recognizes the Holy Trinity and the Son's role in it, while also describing the expanded Sonship concept
2. **Section 3:** Added two new quotes about time/learning ending:
   - UB: "There will come an end sometime to the growth of the Supreme..."
   - Course: "The purpose of time is to enable man to learn to use it constructively..."
   - Added narration connecting the end of evolution (UB) with the end of learning (Course)
3. **Section 7:** Revised paragraph about past-eternity experience to clarify this is the Adjuster's memory stirring within you

### Chapter 8 Review
1. **Section 2:** Added material about "your creations" and purpose, then REVERTED to original after identifying too many quote repetitions
2. **Identified repeated quotes in Chapter 8:**
   - "Your creations are protected..." appears in Sections 2 and 4
   - Scaffolding quote appears in Sections 2, 5, and 7
3. **Decision:** Keep "Your creations are protected..." only in Section 4 (its natural home for identification theme)
4. Reviewed Sections 1-6, no other changes made
