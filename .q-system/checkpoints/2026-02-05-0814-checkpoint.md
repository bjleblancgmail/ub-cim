## Session Summary

Continued editing session on UB-CIM Study Guide.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Chapter 7 Word Doc Comparison
- Compared Word doc (`C:\Users\bjleb\OneDrive\Book\UB-CIM-Study-Guide-edit ch 7.docx`) against markdown source
- Identified 10 substantive changes between Word edits and markdown

### 2. Chapter 7 Edits Applied
Applied Word doc changes to `my-book/chapters/chapter-07-sonship-supreme.md` EXCEPT Change #8:

**Changes Applied:**
- Change #1: "The Course in Miracles uses" → "The Course uses" (line 21)
- Change #2: Simplified Trinity paragraph - removed "The Course acknowledges the Holy Trinity and the Son's role in it. But the Course also describes the Sonship - a larger reality."
- Changes #4-7, 9-10: Removed time/learning content from Section 3 (the completion quote, "Time is a teaching device" paragraph, etc.)

**Change #8 KEPT ORIGINAL (per user request):**
> "Both books teach that you carry past-eternity experience and memory. The Urantia Book attributes this to the Adjuster — the divine fragment that lived in eternity before it came to indwell you. The Course speaks of a song known 'so long ago,' a memory more dear than anything learned in this life. This is the Adjuster's memory, stirring within you. Both books are saying: something vast and beautiful lives inside you, and you will recognize it when you return."

### 3. RandomParallels Document Processing (IN PROGRESS)
- Read full content from `C:\Users\bjleb\OneDrive\CourseUB\RandomParallels 2.0.docx`
- User requested: sort by correlation strength, format, create PDF
- Created initial summarized version (user rejected - wanted EXACT original words preserved)
- Started creating complete version with all original text preserved
- **TASK INTERRUPTED** - needs completion

Files created:
- `C:\Users\bjleb\OneDrive\Book\UB-CIM-Parallels-Sorted.pdf` (first attempt - summarized, needs redo)
- `C:\Users\bjleb\OneDrive\Book\UB-CIM-Parallels-Sorted.md` (first attempt - summarized, needs redo)

## Pending Tasks

1. **RandomParallels PDF** - Redo with ALL original words preserved, just reorganized by correlation strength
   - Source: `C:\Users\bjleb\OneDrive\CourseUB\RandomParallels 2.0.docx`
   - Full extracted text saved at: `C:\Users\bjleb\.claude\projects\C--Alpha-UB-CIM--non-fiction-Author-\6e98535b-6296-49dc-98cb-b3d0d79a97bf\tool-results\toolu_016wvPTXngbQxLm7NvQ13Uf9.txt`

2. From previous session (still pending):
   - Commit repetition cleanup edits (Ch 6, 9, 13, 16)
   - Add Adamic Default entry to Ch 2 Section 5
   - Add Adam/Eve Course reference expansion to Ch 15
   - Rephrase "Course does not speak of material body" in Ch 6
   - Fix Ch 1 inconsistencies: "This study guide" on line 33, "three parts" structure

## Files Modified This Session

- `my-book/chapters/chapter-07-sonship-supreme.md` - Applied Word doc edits (except Change #8)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep Change #8 original (Adjuster memory paragraph) | User preference - preferred the fuller explanation with "This is the Adjuster's memory, stirring within you" |
| RandomParallels must preserve ALL original words | User explicitly requested no summarization |
