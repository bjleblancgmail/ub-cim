**Session:** Joseph working on UB-CIM Study Guide - Parallels organization

---

## Key Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Clarified Parallels File Inventory
Identified 9 parallels-related files across 3 locations:
- Project appendices (2 files)
- Source materials (5 files - original .docx versions)
- OneDrive (3 files)

### 2. Created Full-Quotes Version of Parallels
- **File:** `my-book/appendices/appendix-b-parallels-full.md`
- **Content:** 570 lines, ~100KB, 57 parallels
- **Structure:** 3 tiers (Tier 1: near-identical language, Tier 2: same concept different words, Tier 3: supporting correlations)
- **Key difference:** Preserves FULL quotes from original source, not trimmed

### 3. Renamed Files for Clarity
- `appendix-b-parallels-complete.md` → `appendix-b-parallels-condensed.md`
- Added clear labels to distinguish condensed vs full-quotes versions

### 4. Rewrote All Introductions to Match Book Voice
Changed 57+ introductions from personal notes style to authoritative book voice:
- FROM: "Here is a parallel I noticed..." / "I have always been curious..." / "Did you know..."
- TO: "Both texts reject..." / "The terminology is identical. This is not coincidence." / "Same teaching. Different words."
- Also rewrote closing commentary lines and Personal Reflection → "Closing Note"

### 5. Cleaned Up Duplicate/Obsolete Files
Deleted:
- `UB-CIM-Parallels-Sorted.md` (incomplete earlier attempt)
- `UB-CIM-Parallels-Sorted.pdf` (PDF of incomplete version)
- `UB-CIM-Parallels-Complete.md` (replaced with renamed versions)
