## Accomplishments

1. **Created Appendix A Word document** — `my-book/appendices/Appendix-A-Terminology-Mapping.docx`
   - Georgia font, blue header tables, alternating row shading
   - All 10 category tables + detailed sections + quick reference

2. **Created Chapter 1 EPUB** — `my-book/chapters/chapter-01-introduction.epub`
   - Styled with Georgia serif, blockquotes, section breaks

3. **Created complete book EPUB** — `my-book/UB-CIM-Study-Guide.epub` (142 KB)
   - All 16 chapters + 3 appendices
   - Title page, Part divider pages (Part One/Two/Three), nested TOC
   - Proper CSS styling throughout

4. **Added Part Two transition to Chapter 5** — appended to end of chapter-05-terminology-bridge.md:
   ```
   ## Part Two: Themes
   The nature of reality, the meaning of miracles, spiritual transformation, forgiveness, fear, and what comes after.
   ```

5. **Audio/audiobook discussion:**
   - User asked about text-to-voice; explored TTS options (edge-tts, gTTS, pyttsx3)
   - User chose to focus on formatting for audiobook instead
   - Reformatted Ch 5 Section 2 table as narrated prose (example provided in chat)
   - User decided: lead-in attribution only (no post-quote attributions)
   - Started audit of all blockquotes across 16 chapters for missing source lead-ins
   - Collected full grep audit of all quotes with 3 lines of context
   - **Task interrupted before edits began** — no attribution edits made yet

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Part divider pages in EPUB | User liked them; added Part Two transition to end of Ch 5 |
| Lead-in attribution only | User chose this over post-quote or both; cleaner for audio |
| Skip appendices for attribution audit | User explicitly said do not change appendices |
| Tables need narrated format for audio | Tables don't work in audio; convert to "CIM speaks of X. UB calls this Y." pattern |

## Files Created

- `my-book/appendices/Appendix-A-Terminology-Mapping.docx`
- `my-book/chapters/chapter-01-introduction.epub`
- `my-book/UB-CIM-Study-Guide.epub`

## Files Modified

- `my-book/chapters/chapter-05-terminology-bridge.md` (added Part Two transition at end)

---

## Next Actions (In Progress)

- [ ] **Quote attribution audit** — Go through all 16 chapters, ensure every blockquote has a clear lead-in identifying source (UB or CIM). Full grep audit completed but NO edits made yet.
- [ ] Rebuild EPUB after attribution edits
- [ ] Consider audiobook-ready manuscript (tables converted to narrated prose)
- [ ] Remaining items from last session's list (Appendix C-F, Ch 2/6/15 edits, Ch 1 fixes)
