## Accomplishments So Far

1. **Quote attribution audit — ALL 16 chapters complete**
   - Converted all post-quote em-dash attributions to lead-in style
   - Added explicit source names ("The Urantia Book says:" / "The Course says:") to every blockquote missing one
   - ~45 fixes total across all 16 chapters
   - Each chapter committed individually (16 commits)

2. **Removed all "source material" references — 5 chapters**
   - Ch 2: Blockquote about UB history → author's narration
   - Ch 12: "The source material suggests" → "The answer is simple"
   - Ch 13: Blockquote about adjutants/ego → author's narration
   - Ch 14: Blockquote about "nothing to fear" → author's narration
   - Ch 15: Two instances — blockquote → narration + "source material asks" → first person "I"
   - Rationale: "source material" was Joseph's own voice, same voice speaking in the book

3. **Fixed misattribution in Ch 8**
   - "Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole..." was attributed to the Course but is actually from The Urantia Book
   - Fixed lead-in from "The Course also speaks" → "The Urantia Book also speaks"

4. **Ch 8 Sec 5 rewrite — removed survival refusal passage**
   - Removed quote: "When this sentence is finally confirmed... the being immediately becomes as though he had not been."
   - Removed surrounding discussion about beings who refuse survival and cease to exist
   - Joseph's rationale: "this is a deep topic for another book"
   - Section flows naturally without it (sand/ego paragraph → mercy paragraph)

5. **Pushed all 20 commits to GitHub**

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Lead-in only attribution style | Chosen by Joseph for audiobook clarity — no post-quote attributions |
| Do NOT modify appendices | Joseph explicitly said appendices stay unchanged |
| Remove all "source material" framing | Joseph: "that is my voice, the same voice that is speaking in the book" |
| Remove survival refusal passage (Ch 8) | Joseph: "this is a deep topic for another book" |
| Worship quote is UB not CIM | Joseph caught misattribution — "Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole" is Urantia Book |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Session wrap-up / checkpoint
**All planned edits complete.** No partially completed work.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Rebuild EPUB after all attribution/source material edits
- [ ] Consider audiobook-ready manuscript (tables converted to narrated prose)
- [ ] Remaining items from prior sessions: Appendix C-F, Ch 2/6/15 edits, Ch 1 fixes
- [ ] Review Ch 8 for remaining DRAFT status — may be ready for COMPLETE
