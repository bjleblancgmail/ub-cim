## Accomplishments Since Last Checkpoint (12:42)

1. **Created `/q-audio-ready` command** — `.claude/commands/q-audio-ready.md`
   - Generates audio-ready text copies for ElevenLabs TTS
   - Handles: em dash removal, table→prose conversion, markdown stripping, blockquote markers
   - Outputs to `my-book/audio/` — never modifies original files
   - Can output .txt files or single EPUB (ElevenLabs prefers EPUB)

2. **Created quote bank** — `my-book/notes/quote-bank.md`
   - Water-to-wine quote (UB Paper 137:4) — "abrogation of time"
   - Seven circles quote (UB 110:6.21) — adjutant mind termination at first circle
   - Religious perplexities quote (UB 100:4.2) — animal mind rebels against spiritual growth

3. **Added seven circles quote to Ch 13 Section 4**
   - Placed after existing circles/adjutant discussion
   - Shows the destination: mastery of first circle = adjutant mind no longer dominates = what Course calls knowledge
   - Committed

4. **Added religious perplexities quote to Ch 11 Section 4**
   - Placed in "Fringe of Conflict" section after "This is normal. This is the price of growth."
   - Full quote used (Brian chose full over trimmed)
   - Bridges to Course's ego resistance concept
   - Committed

5. **Fixed Ch 8 misattribution** — worship quote ("Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole") was attributed to Course, actually from Urantia Book

6. **Removed "source material" references from 5 chapters** (Ch 2, 12, 13, 14, 15) — Brian: "that is my voice, the same voice speaking in the book"

7. **Ch 8 Sec 5 rewrite** — removed survival refusal passage ("as though he had not been") — Brian: "deep topic for another book"

8. **Pushed all work to GitHub** (20 commits at that point)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Lead-in only attribution style | Brian chose for audiobook clarity |
| Do NOT modify appendices | Brian explicit |
| Remove "source material" framing | Brian: "that is my voice" |
| Remove survival refusal passage Ch 8 | Brian: "deep topic for another book" |
| Worship quote is UB not CIM | Brian caught misattribution |
| Full quote for UB 100:4.2 | Brian chose full over trimmed version |
| Em dashes cause ElevenLabs audio glitches | Replace with commas in audio-ready version |
| EPUB is ElevenLabs' preferred format | Auto-detects chapters from H1 headings |
