# Checkpoint: 2026-02-07-0806 - Quote Verification Audit

**Session focus:** Verifying all UB and JCIM quotes across book chapters against official sources.

**Tools used:**
- urantia.org search (Tab 0) for UB quotes
- cocreatingclarity.org/JCIM5/searchapp.htm (Tab 2) for JCIM quotes
- jcim.net (Tab 1) open but not used for searching

---

## Changes Made This Session

### Chapter 5 (chapter-05-terminology-bridge.md)
- **Section 3 rewrite:** Removed fake quote on line 61 ("Souls: Divine Monitor, Thought Adjuster, indestructible universe reality...") which was Joseph's own summary formatted as a blockquote, not from either source book.
- Replaced with three verified JCIM quotes: Tx:1.45, Tx:1.68, Tx:30.41

### Chapter 6 (chapter-06-central-thesis.md)
- **Line 151 fix:** Split spliced quote from two different UB papers (110:2.4 + 108:6.5) into two separate properly attributed quotes. Restored omitted "(only spiritually)" qualifier.
