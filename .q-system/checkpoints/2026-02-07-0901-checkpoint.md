## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove fake "..." splices in Ch 8 | Pattern: real first sentence + fabricated second sentence after "..." |
| Absorb fabricated text into Joseph's prose | Keeps the ideas but removes false attribution |
| Remove line 189 entirely | No real UB quote to replace it with; surrounding prose carries the point |

## Pattern Discovered in Ch 8

Ch 8 has a recurring pattern not seen in earlier chapters: quotes that use "..." to bridge a REAL first sentence from the source with a FABRICATED second sentence. This occurred in 3 JCIM quotes (lines 89, 183, 237) and 1 UB quote (line 195). The fix pattern is: keep only the verified text in the blockquote, move the idea into Joseph's own prose.
