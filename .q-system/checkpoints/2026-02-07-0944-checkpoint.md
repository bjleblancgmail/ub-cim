## Accomplishments Since Last Checkpoint

### Chapter 8 - COMPLETE (all 8 fixes applied)
- Applied remaining 3 fixes (Issues 6, 7, 8):
  - Line 203 UB NOT FOUND ("He always looked beyond...") - absorbed into Joseph's prose
  - Line 247 UB NOT FOUND ("The Adjuster is always trying to spiritual idealize...") - absorbed into prose, changed "embarrassingly small" to "barely formed" and "smallness" to "imperfection" per Joseph's feedback
  - Line 259 UB NOT FOUND ("You will greatly enjoy your progress...") - absorbed into prose

### Chapter 9 - COMPLETE (2 fixes applied)
- Verified all 6 UB quotes (all exact match)
- Verified all 9 unique JCIM quotes (10 total with 1 repeat)
- Found 2 issues:
  1. Line 119: "Miracles make minds one in God" vs official "[Miracles make Souls one in Christ.]" (Tx:1.19) - dropped inaccurate first sentence, kept verified second sentence
  2. Line 133: Paraphrase presented as direct quote ("observable effects" vs "be effective") - absorbed into Joseph's prose
- Minor noted: Line 13 "in miracles" vs official "among miracles" (Tx:1.1)

### Chapter 10 - COMPLETE (2 fixes applied)
- Verified all 10 UB quotes (9 unique)
- Verified all 9 unique JCIM quotes (10 total with 1 repeat)
- Found 2 issues:
  1. Line 101: UB SPLICE - "The Adjusters are the will of God" real (108:4.2), but rest fabricated ("creature co-creators," "potential of conflict," "chosen the eternal career"). Rewrote with corrected theology: Adjuster = will, personality = choice (per Joseph's theological correction)
  2. Line 173: UB quote adds "and perfection of spiritual nature" not in original (101:6.17) - trimmed
- Minor noted: Line 79 "a finite creature" vs "the finite creature" (103:0.1)

### Chapter 11 - COMPLETE (0 fixes needed)
- Verified all 10 UB quotes (8 new + 2 repeats from earlier chapters)
- Verified all 5 JCIM quotes
- ALL CLEAN - no issues found. Cleanest chapter yet.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Changed "embarrassingly small" to "barely formed" in Ch 8 | Joseph felt original sounded insulting |
| Ch 9 line 119: drop first sentence, keep second | First sentence had two word changes (minds/Souls, God/Christ), second sentence verified |
| Ch 10 line 101: rewrote prose with Adjuster theology correction | Joseph pointed out Adjuster IS the will, doesn't "will" things. Personality has volition. |
| Ch 10 line 173: trim added phrase | "and perfection of spiritual nature" not in original UB text |

## Patterns Discovered

- Ch 8: "..." splice pattern (real first sentence + fabricated second)
- Ch 10: Fabricated theological content about Adjuster "willing" things (corrected: Adjuster IS will, personality has volition)
- Ch 11: Clean chapter - no issues. Later chapters may be cleaner as Joseph's writing matured.
