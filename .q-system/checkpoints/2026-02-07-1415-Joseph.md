## Accomplishments So Far

- Fixed Appendix A line 317: replaced fabricated UB quote with authentic UB 181:2.20 (Jesus to Philip, "eye of spiritual faith")
- Found replacement quote by searching Joseph's local source material (not web)
- Verified all 17 UB quotes in Appendix A against urantia.org (all clean)
- Verified all 15 CIM quotes in Appendix A against cocreatingclarity.org/JCIM5 search (all clean)
- Appendix A fully verified, zero remaining issues
- Started Appendix B (condensed) verification: 2 of 57 JCIM parallels verified so far (#1 Tx:2.56, #2 Tx:1.80)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace line 317 with UB 181:2.20 (Jesus to Philip) | "Eye of spiritual faith" vs "eyes of the material mind" pairs perfectly with CIM spiritual eye quote; Joseph had it highlighted in caps in source material |
| Search local source material first, not web | Joseph's preference to use his own research notes |
| Use only urantia.org and cocreatingclarity.org/JCIM5/searchapp.htm for verification | Joseph's explicit instruction; no other sites |
| Use browser (Playwright) for searches so Joseph can watch | Joseph's preference from prior sessions |
| Verify only condensed Appendix B, not full | Joseph's decision to skip the 111KB full version |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Verifying JCIM quotes in Appendix B condensed (57 parallels)
**Partially complete:** 2 of 57 JCIM parallels verified in browser
**UB quotes in Appendix B:** Not yet started (will do after JCIM)

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete JCIM quote verification for remaining 55 parallels in Appendix B condensed
- [ ] Verify UB quotes in Appendix B condensed against urantia.org
- [ ] Report any fabricated or misquoted text to Joseph before fixing
- [ ] After Appendix B: final comprehensive verification report
- [ ] Citation style decision and one editing pass
