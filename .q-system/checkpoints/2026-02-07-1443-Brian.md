## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace line 317 with UB 181:2.20 | "Eye of spiritual faith" pairs with CIM spiritual eye quote; from Brian's source material |
| Use only urantia.org and cocreatingclarity.org/JCIM5/searchapp.htm | Brian's explicit instruction |
| Use Playwright browser for searches | Brian wants to watch searches live in Chrome |
| Verify only condensed Appendix B | Brian's decision |
| Flag #8 and move on | Brian chose to come back to it later |

## Current Status

**Working on:** JCIM quote verification in Appendix B condensed, currently at #25
**Partially complete:** 24 of 57 parallels verified
**Flagged for review:** #8 (truth is unalterable), #17 (crusade phrasing)
