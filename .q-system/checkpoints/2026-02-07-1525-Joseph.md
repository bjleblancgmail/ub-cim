- Replaced #8 JCIM quote with Tx:5.46 ("Truth is beyond your ability to destroy...")
- Confirmed #17 is clean in OE at Tx:1.31 ("Crusade" phrasing verified)
- Replaced #52 commentary with actual JCIM quote M:9.2 ("As the teacher of God advances...")
- Completed UB quote verification for all 63 UB quotes in Appendix B condensed against urantia.org
- Found and fixed 3 UB reference number discrepancies: 40:6.3->40:6.5, 1:9.3->11:9.3, 136:5.4->136:5.5
- Updated Appendix B title from "UB-CIM Parallels: Quick Reference" to "Selected Parallels: Urantia Book and Course in Miracles"
- Updated book outline: restored CIM Miracle Principles as Appendix C, re-lettered D-G

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace #8 with Tx:5.46 | Joseph chose Option 2: "Truth is beyond your ability to destroy..." |
| Replace #52 with M:9.2 | Joseph chose Option 2: "As the teacher of God advances in his training..." |
| Rename Appendix B | Was "Quick Reference (Condensed)," now "Selected Parallels" to accurately describe content |
| Add Appendix C for Miracle Principles | Original plan had this as B; now separate from Selected Parallels |
| 7 appendices total (A-G) | Joseph's decision to keep both Selected Parallels and Miracle Principles |
