## Accomplishments So Far

- Rewrote Chapter 5, Section 2 (Core Mappings): replaced column/row table with 10 numbered left-to-right mapping paragraphs, audio-friendly format
- Added new mapping #2 "Your Creations = Morontia Soul" to distinguish from Soul/Adjuster
- Combined Soul and Altar into single mapping entry (#1)
- Added new mapping #8 "The 'I' of Jesus = The Spirit of Truth"
- Added intro line to Section 2 explaining Course term appears first, UB term second
- Replaced slashes with commas in mapping titles for audio readability
- Added blank lines after each mapping title for readability
- Added new Section 6 "Will and Personality" to Chapter 5 (after Perception and Knowledge)
- Renumbered Chapter 5 sections (now 1-9 instead of 1-8)
- Fixed inaccurate statement in Chapter 8, Section 4 (What Makes You Real): rewrote "identity with the one identity that cannot be destroyed" to focus on personality and Thought Adjuster being eternal
- Added Course quote to Chapter 7, Section 3 (What is God the Supreme?): "What is timeless is always there, because its being is eternally changeless. It does not change by increase, because it was forever created to increase."
- Added emphasis paragraph after the quote explaining the changeless-yet-expanding nature of God
- Searched source material for bread miracle / shortening time references (not found in source material)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace table with numbered paragraphs | Audio-friendly format, reads left to right |
| Course term first, UB term second in mappings | Consistent convention, explained in intro |
| Combine Soul + Altar into one entry | Both map to Thought Adjuster, cleaner as one |
| Add "Your Creations = Morontia Soul" as separate entry | Distinct from Soul/Adjuster, important distinction |
| Add Spirit of Truth after Holy Spirit (not combined) | Keep the two ministries clearly separate |
| Use commas instead of slashes | Slashes sound weird in audio |
| Place "changeless yet expanding" quote in Ch 7 Sec 3 | Best fit: right after "A God who is still becoming?" question |
| Keep identity language positive in Ch 8 | Don't mention identity may not survive, stay positive |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Joseph asked about the bread miracle and shortening time, exploring whether to add UB feeding of five thousand to Chapter 9
**Partially complete:** Chapter 5 Section 2 is done, but the Spirit of Truth note (lines 49+) may need review since some content was elevated to mappings
