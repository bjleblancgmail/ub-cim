## Accomplishments So Far

### This session (continuation of citation pass, appendices):
- Completed citation pass on Appendix A (Terminology Mapping): added 33 citations (17 JCIM, 16 UB)
- Searched and found 2 previously unknown UB references:
  - "The Supreme Being thus becomes the finite synthesis..." = UB Paper 117, 117:1.2
  - "blessed with spiritual vision, go forth to your work..." = UB Paper 181, 181:2.20
- Read Appendix B (Parallels Condensed) in full, was beginning to catalog its blockquotes when interrupted

**Total citations added this session: 33 (Appendix A)**
**Combined with all previous sessions: 182 total citation edits across all chapters and Appendix A**

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- my-book/appendices/appendix-a-terminology-mapping.md (33 citations added)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Citation format: (UB Paper X, X:Y.Z) | Matches Chapter 1 established format |
| Citation format: (JCIM, Chapter X, Tx X.Y) | Matches Chapter 1 established format |
| Introduction citations: (JCIM, Introduction, Tx I.X) | For Course Introduction quotes |
| Cite each occurrence of repeated quotes | Every blockquote gets its own citation |
| Only use urantia.org and cocreatingclarity.org for searches | Per Joseph's instruction |
| Reuse known references from chapter work | Most Appendix A quotes already found during chapter passes |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Citation pass through Appendix B (appendix-b-parallels-condensed.md)
**Completed:** All 16 chapters + Appendix A
**Read but not yet edited:** Appendix B (784 lines, ~57 parallels with many blockquotes)
**Next up:** Appendix B citations, then Appendix C

---

## Appendix B Analysis (Pre-work)

Appendix B contains 57 parallels. Many UB quotes already include paper references inline (e.g., "Urantia Book (118:9.4):"). JCIM quotes generally do NOT have citations. Need to:
- Add citations to all blockquotes that lack them
- Some UB references are already provided in the headers (e.g., "Urantia Book (40:6.5):")
- Some JCIM quotes have partial references (e.g., "JCIM (Tx:5.46):" or "JCIM (M:9.2):")
- Many JCIM quotes have NO references at all and need searching

Known JCIM references from chapter work that appear in Appendix B:
- Tx 5.32, Tx 5.9, Tx 1.83, Tx 1.19, Tx 27.15, Tx 11.59, Tx 4.49, Tx 1.56, Tx 8.45, Tx 4.89

## Next Steps

- [ ] Continue citation pass: Appendix B (57 parallels, many quotes need JCIM citations)
- [ ] Continue citation pass: Appendix C (miracle principles)
- [ ] Commit all citation work when complete
- [ ] Resume pending work: Group A (~85 citations from annotated doc), Group B comments, Group C corrections
- [ ] Appendices D through G
