## Accomplishments So Far

### Appendix C: Complete Rewrite
- Replaced all 25 miracle principle commentaries with new polished versions (user provided new text)
- Removed closing "Principles 26-50" note per user request
- Rewrote Principle 24 from scratch using source material research:
  - Acknowledged "he made sickness and death" has no clean UB parallel
  - Reframed around Jesus' actual healings, mind-made universe (UB 42:11.2), rebellion's effects on natural progression
  - Added UB 149:1.4 (three conditions of healing), UB 34:7.3 (normal worlds), UB 117:3.5 (immortal soul)
  - All healing conditions are mental, not physical

### Appendix B: Commentary Rewrite (Parallels 1-35 of 57 complete)
- Rewrote commentary for all 35 parallels, replacing short italic summary lines with expanded prose
- All original quotes preserved unchanged
- Parallel 22: expanded JCIM quote to full Tx:18.5 passage per user request

### Chapter 15: Section 5 Expanded
- Added collective responsibility / Sonship organism commentary
- Added body/cell analogy (liver/kidney metaphor)
- Added forgiveness as healing connections within the Sonship
- Preserved existing agondontors content

### Research for Principle 24
- Searched all source material files for relevant UB and JCIM quotes
- Found key quotes: JCIM W1 84.2, UB 42:11.2, UB 149:1.4, UB 3:4.7, UB 42:12.12, UB 189:1.3
- User directed away from "no parallel" approach toward Jesus/mind-based healing approach

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- my-book/appendices/appendix-c-miracle-principles.md (full rewrite of all 25 principles + Principle 24 custom rewrite)
- my-book/appendices/appendix-b-parallels-condensed.md (commentary rewritten for parallels 1-35, quote expanded for parallel 22)
- my-book/chapters/chapter-15-lucifer-rebellion-why-we-suffer.md (Section 5 expanded with Sonship/collective responsibility)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Principle 24: no clean UB parallel for "made sickness and death" | User directed: too simplistic, humans did not make sickness and death |
| Principle 24: approach from Jesus/mind perspective | User directed: mind-made universe, rebellion altered progression, healing is mental |
| Appendix B: rewrite commentary one parallel at a time | User requested seeing full CURRENT and PROPOSED for each parallel before applying |
| Appendix B: show in batches of 5 | User requested this pace |
| Appendix B: show entire parallel (header + quotes + commentary) | User insisted on seeing everything, not just commentary changes |
| Parallel 22: use full Tx:18.5 quote | User provided the expanded quote |
| Chapter 15 Section 5: add collective responsibility commentary | User asked where the Sonship organism discussion could go; chose Ch15 S5 |
| No em dashes in any output | Standing rule for ElevenLabs TTS |

- [ ] Citation pass on Appendix B (blockquotes need inline citations)
- [ ] Citation pass on Appendix C
- [ ] Commit all work when complete
- [ ] Resume pending work: Group A (~85 citations from annotated doc), Group B comments, Group C corrections
