## Accomplishments So Far

### Author Name Change
- Changed author name from Brian to Joseph throughout project
- Updated CLAUDE.md with author name policy
- Replaced "Brian" with "Joseph" in 28 .q-system files (checkpoints, transcripts, session-notes)
- Renamed 20 files from *-Brian.md to *-Joseph.md
- Source material (Scrivener files) left unchanged to avoid corruption

### Appendix B Commentary Rewrite: COMPLETED (all 57 parallels)
- Resumed from Parallel 36 (Parallels 1-35 done in prior session)
- Completed Parallels 36-40, 41-45, 46-50, 51-55, 56-57
- Each batch shown as full CURRENT and PROPOSED, approved by Joseph, then applied
- All old italic one-liner commentaries replaced with expanded prose paragraphs

### Notable Parallel Changes
- Parallel 38: Extended research on pre-temporal reality and "hypothetical beginning" (UB 105:1.5, 106:0.9). Discussion about Course's "separation" vs UB's positive time-space creation. Final commentary focuses on both texts agreeing time-space is purposeful and designed.
- Parallel 41: Replaced weak UB quote (117:1.4 about living organism) with much stronger UB 117:6.21 ("No single ascender will ever find the Supreme until all ascenders have reached that maximum universe maturity")
- Parallel 51: Removed sovereignty number reference per Joseph's request

### Research Discussion Saved
- Saved full space-time/separation discussion to .q-system/research-notes/2026-02-08-spacetime-separation-discussion.md
- Covers pre-temporal reality, hypothetical beginning, Course's "separation" on multiple levels, Joseph's correction that time-space is positive/creative not negative

### Citation Pass on Appendix B: STARTED (not yet applied)
- Cataloged all 57 parallels: all UB quotes have references in headers, ~53 JCIM quotes need references added
- Only 4 JCIM quotes already have references: Parallel 8 (Tx:5.46), Parallel 22 (Tx:18.5), Parallel 31 (Adjuster substitution), Parallel 52 (M:9.2)
- Began researching JCIM references via full-quotes source file and jcim.net
- Found: Parallel 1 = Chapter 2, Tx:2.56; Parallel 2 = Chapter 1, Tx:1.80 and Tx:1.78; Parallel 3 = Chapter 9; Parallel 5 = Manual section 21
- cocreatingclarity.org search site was down; used jcim.net directly
- Stalled while loading full Chapter 1 page (very large) - interrupted by user

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Author name = Joseph, never Brian/LeBlanc | User requested anonymization |
| Keep bjleblancgmail GitHub username in CLAUDE.md | Functional credential, not author name |
| Don't edit Scrivener source material files | Risk of binary/structured file corruption |
| Parallel 38: Focus on purposeful time-space, not separation | Joseph corrected: UB's time-space is positive creation, not separation |
| Parallel 41: Replace UB 117:1.4 with 117:6.21 | Original quote was weak parallel; 117:6.21 matches "joint will" concept precisely |
| Parallel 51: Remove sovereignty number | Joseph requested removal |
| Save space-time discussion for later reference | Joseph requested full conversation preserved |
| No em dashes in any output | Standing rule for ElevenLabs TTS |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Citation pass on Appendix B (adding JCIM references to quote headers)
**Partially complete:** Research phase - identified references for Parallels 1-5 from source material and jcim.net, but stalled loading large webpage
**Not yet applied:** No citation edits applied yet

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Continue citation pass on Appendix B: add JCIM references to all ~53 quote headers
- [ ] Citation pass on Appendix C
- [ ] Commit all work when complete
- [ ] Resume pending work: Group A (~85 citations from annotated doc), Group B comments, Group C corrections
