### Discovery: Appendix A Core Terminology Rewrite Was Lost
- Joseph reported that a previous session rewrote the Core Terminology table (removed table format, added terms, used prose)
- No record in any checkpoint, session note, or git history
- Current file still has old table format
- Rewrite needs to be redone

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- my-book/appendices/appendix-b-parallels-condensed.md (53 JCIM citation headers added to Parallels 1-53)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use cocreatingclarity.org/JCIM5 for all JCIM lookups | Joseph directed; christmind.info was rejected |
| Present citations in batches of 5 for approval | Joseph's standing request from previous session |
| Multiple quotes under one header get combined ref (e.g., Tx:21.4, 21.51) | Keeps header clean while being precise |
| Workbook refs use W1: prefix (e.g., W1:19.2, W1:169.12, W1:105.3) | Matches cocreatingclarity.org reference format |
| Manual refs use M: prefix (e.g., M:21.1, M:9.2) | Matches existing format in file |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Citation pass on Appendix B, Parallels 54-57 (last 4, researched but not applied)
**Partially complete:** Parallels 54-57 references found, awaiting approval and application
**Discovered issue:** Appendix A Core Terminology rewrite was lost from a previous session

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Apply Parallels 54-57 citations (Tx:14.39, Tx:30.1, Tx:10.69, W1:105.3)
- [ ] Redo Appendix A Core Terminology rewrite (lost from previous session)
- [ ] Citation pass on Appendix C
- [ ] Commit all work
- [ ] Resume pending work: Group A (~85 citations), Group B comments, Group C corrections
