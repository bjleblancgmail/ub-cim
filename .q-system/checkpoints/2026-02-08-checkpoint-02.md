# Checkpoint: 2026-02-08 Session 2 (Appendix A Reimagine)

**Participant:** Joseph
**Time:** Mid-session checkpoint

---

## Key Accomplishments

- Read all 16 chapters, Appendices B and C, and existing Appendix A in full
- Created reimagined Appendix A as new file: `my-book/appendices/appendix-a-terminology-mapping-v2.md`
- New structure organized as a spiritual journey in 9 parts:
  1. Where You Start (ego, perception, fear, split mind, the separation)
  2. What Lives Within You (soul/Adjuster, spark, will, creations)
  3. The Help You Are Given (Holy Spirit, Spirit of Truth, Mind of Christ)
  4. The Work (miracle, forgiveness, sin, transfer, circles)
  5. What You Are Learning to See (real/unreal, shadow, dream, real world, spiritual eye)
  6. Time and Miracles (time, miracles shorten time)
  7. The Collective Dimension (Sonship/Supreme, Atonement)
  8. The Destination (bridge, last step, awakening, one-mindedness)
  9. The Divine (Father, Son, Christ, Trinity)
- All prose, no tables (except Quick Reference at end)
- Audio-ready format throughout
- No em dashes used

## Joseph's Review Edits (Applied)

Joseph reviewed and removed entries that were not true CIM-to-UB terminology mappings:
- **Removed Mota entry** - purely a UB term, not a mapping
- **Removed Eternity entry** - not a CIM term being mapped
- **Removed Laws of Eternity entry** - not a true mapping
- **Removed Now / Holy Instant entry** - not a clean mapping
- **Removed Brothers entry** - same word in both texts, not a mapping
- **Quick Reference** replaced with Joseph's preferred 15-core-mapping table format (proper markdown table with CIM | UB columns)

## Files Changed

**Created:**
- `my-book/appendices/appendix-a-terminology-mapping-v2.md` (new reimagined appendix)

**Modified (earlier in session, before reimagine decision):**
- `my-book/appendices/appendix-a-terminology-mapping.md` (Fusion Process table converted to prose - done before Joseph asked for full reimagine)

## Current State

- Original Appendix A untouched (except the one Fusion Process edit from early session)
- New v2 file has had 5 entries removed per Joseph's review
- Quick Reference is now a proper markdown table
- Joseph still reviewing - may have more changes

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| New file instead of editing original | Joseph wanted to compare, keep original intact |
| Journey-based organization (9 parts) | Better flow than categorical listing; tells a story |
| No quotes in prose entries | Quotes live in chapters and Appendix B; keeps this clean |
| Removed non-mapping entries | Joseph correctly identified terms that aren't CIM-to-UB bridges |
| Quick Reference as markdown table | Joseph wants the fast-lookup section in column/row format |

## Next Actions

- [ ] Joseph to continue reviewing v2 for more removals or edits
- [ ] Decide whether v2 replaces original or stays as separate file
- [ ] Consider if any entries need strengthening or rewording
- [ ] Eventually generate audio-ready version of final appendix
