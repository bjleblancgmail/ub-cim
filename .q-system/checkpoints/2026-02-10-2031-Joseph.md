## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Chapter 9, Section 2 Expanded ("Miracles Shorten Time")
- Rewrote Section 2 from ~25 lines to ~75 lines
- Added horizontal-to-vertical perception shift from CIM
- Added doer/receiver equality as the mechanism of time-shortening
- Added Veronica healing story (UB 152:0.2-3) replacing bread multiplication
- Added "out-of-pattern time interval" concept
- Added closing paragraph on miracles (from below) and revelation (from above) working together
- Used CIM Miracle Principle 28 quote about subconscious/superconscious levels
- Multiple rounds of revision with Joseph on the closing paragraph
- Final version focuses on learning acceleration through consciousness reorganization
- **File changed:** my-book/chapters/chapter-09-miracles-and-time.md (Section 2 replaced)

### 2. "This is not..." Pattern Thinned Across Manuscript
- Identified 12 occurrences of "This is not metaphor/poetry/punishment" pattern
- Kept 3 strongest: Ch 6:13, Ch 7:199, Ch 8:151
- Rewrote 9 others with varied language
- **Files changed:** chapter-06, chapter-07, chapter-08, chapter-11, chapter-15

### 3. Chapter 11 Edit
- Removed "Eventually, completely unreal." from line 49

### 4. Appendix B Quick Reference Table Fixes
- Changed "Spirit of Truth / Mind of Jesus" → "Holy Spirit / Mind of Jesus"
- Changed "The Bestowal / Plan of Ascension" → "Plan of Ascension"

### 5. Appendix C Edit
- Removed "Principles 26-50 will be added in a future edition."
- Rewrote Principle 2 commentary: changed "source of miracles is the Adjuster" to "source of miracles is divine" (more cautious, avoids overclaiming)

### 6. Chapter 8 Edit
- Changed "The Holy Spirit holds them" to "The Holy Spirit knows of them" re: creations

### 7. Urtext Search Capability Established
- Extracted URTEXTW6[1].DOC (full urtext, 321,721 words) to searchable text files
- Created: source-material/CourseUB/urtext_extracted.txt and urtext_lines.txt
- These files enable fast searching of the entire Course urtext

### 8. Deep Research: Annihilation / Survival Debate
- Searched urtext for CIM parallels to UB's annihilation teaching
- Found key passages:
  - Line 1136: "The wicked shall perish is merely a statement of fact" - every loveless thought must be undone
  - Line 1137: "The part of your thought given to the ego will merely return to the Kingdom"
  - Line 604: "The mind will inevitably disown its miscreations, and having withdrawn belief from them, they will no longer exist"
  - Line 118: "If a mind creates without love, it can create an empty shell. This CAN be possessed by evil... emptiness is a false creation"
  - Line 282: "He CAN destroy his medium of communication, but NOT his potential"
  - Line 206: "The Creation of the Soul is already fully accomplished. The mind, if it votes to do so, becomes a medium by which the Soul can create along the line of its own creation"
  - Lines 2526-2528: Sin as real vs sin as mistake (the ego's insistence that sin is truth)
- Found Joseph's existing source material on this topic in Docs/48.rtf and Docs/72.rtf ("WHAT IS UNREAL VERSUS REAL FROM A SPIRIT PERSPECTIVE")
- Key CIM quote NOT yet in manuscript: "You cannot distort reality and know what it is... you are trying to make yourself unreal"

### 9. Deep Research: Identity / Personality / Soul in Course
- Explored how Course uses "identity" (changeless, from God = UB's personality)
- Found Course's "concept of the self" (lines 3640-3668) = temporal self-image, not same as UB identity
- Joseph corrected: UB identity is the GROWING self (soul), not the false self
- Found Course's Soul = UB's personality (changeless, never leaves God's sight)
- Found Course's mind (the chooser) = the thing between personality and Adjuster
- Found Course's creations = UB's survival values / morontia soul
- Key insight: Course says mind can create "empty shell" (creating without love), and miscreations "will no longer exist" once disowned. This subtly parallels UB's annihilation.
- Course says "He CAN destroy his medium of communication, but NOT his potential" = identity can die but personality/Adjuster endure

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use Veronica instead of bread multiplication | Fits learning/recognition theme better than material process |
| Miracles from below, revelation from above, working together | Based on CIM Principle 28; Joseph's insight that they're intertwined |
| Keep revelation discussion focused on learning/time | Joseph wanted to stay on topic, not expand into 3-level framework |
| Source of miracles is "divine" not "the Adjuster" | More cautious; Course says miracles come from subconscious, Adjuster is superconscious |
| "Holy Spirit knows of them" instead of "holds them" | Joseph's preference for precision |
| Keep urtext search files for future use | Enables fast searching in future sessions |
