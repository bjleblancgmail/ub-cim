### 3. "This is not" Pattern Cataloged
- 24 occurrences of "This is not..." across chapters and appendices
- 23 unique phrases, 1 duplicate ("This is not coincidence" in ch-02 and ch-04)
- "poetry" appears 2 times total in book

### 4. Editorial Review Problems Discussed
- Problem #1 (Repetition): Addressed via quote audit above
- Problem #2 (No opposing views): Reviewed ch-01 through ch-04, Joseph declined all suggested controversy paragraphs ("no change, next" for each)
- Problem #5 (Formulaic structure): Analyzed all 17 chapters for structural patterns

### 5. Formulaic Structure Analysis (Complete)
- Mapped the structure of all 17 chapters
- Identified most formulaic: Ch 7, 13, 11, 6
- Identified best variation: Ch 17, 15, 3, 1, 12

### 6. Chapter 7 Revision Draft (In Progress)
- Created side-by-side HTML comparison: `Hold Files/chapter-07-comparison.html`
- Current chapter (left) vs proposed revision (right)
- Key changes in proposed revision:
  - Section 1: Rewritten opening (no "They are the same concept" declaration)
  - Section 4: Rewritten "Sum of All Parts" - all 5 quotes kept but woven into symphony argument instead of mechanical CIM/UB/equivalence pattern
  - Section 5: Duplicate UB quote removed, tightened
  - Section 6: Duplicate UB blockquote replaced with paraphrase
  - Section 8: One redundant UB blockquote removed
- Joseph removed the proposed "But Are They Really the Same?" new section
- Joseph has NOT yet approved or rejected the Ch 7 revision draft
- The actual chapter-07-sonship-supreme.md file has NOT been changed

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep "will of God" in ch-01 and ch-06, cut from ch-08 | Joseph preferred to keep the introduction quote |
| Keep "brothers in flesh" full long-form in ch-06 only | Ch-06:223 has the full passage; others paraphrased |
| Keep "map/walking" section in ch-06:203 | Full development earns the metaphor |
| Keep "I am in charge" duplicate in ch-05 | Joseph's choice to leave both |
| No controversy paragraphs added to ch-01 through ch-04 | Joseph declined all suggestions |
| No "But Are They Really the Same?" section in ch-07 draft | Joseph preferred not to go there |
