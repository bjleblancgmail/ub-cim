## Accomplishments So Far

- Located and read TheWorld.pdf (source material by Doug, Yahoo! Groups 2003)
- Summarized the document's core argument: "world" in ACIM means perceptual framework, not planet Earth
- Identified 12 usable Urtext quotes from the document proving God created the physical universe
- Surveyed 7 chapters for integration opportunities, ranked by priority
- Decided against creating a new standalone chapter (would be redundant with Ch 8 and Ch 13)
- Created HTML comparison and applied 4 changes to Chapter 8 (What Is Real?)
- Created HTML comparison and applied 3 changes to Chapter 13 (Perception vs Knowledge)
- Created HTML comparison and applied 2 changes to Chapter 12 (Forgiveness: Mercy vs Love)
- Joseph suggested connecting "punch as cry for love" to Jesus's "turn the other cheek" teaching; found UB 159:5.9 quote and integrated it
- Caught duplicate monster analogy (used in both Ch 8 and Ch 12), deleted it from Ch 12
- Created HTML comparison and applied 2 changes to Chapter 6 (Central Thesis)
- Created HTML comparison for Chapter 5 (Terminology Bridge) but Joseph decided to skip it (redundant)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No new chapter for "the world" topic | Would be redundant with Ch 8 and Ch 13 which already cover the ground |
| Start with Ch 8 for integrations | Most at risk of being misread as denying physical reality |
| Add "turn the other cheek" (UB 159:5.9) to Ch 12 | Joseph's suggestion; reframes one of most misunderstood teachings |
| Delete monster analogy from Ch 12 | Already used in Ch 8; would be redundant for cover-to-cover readers |
| Skip Ch 5 glossary entries | Concepts already fully treated in Ch 6 and Ch 8; no need to repeat |

## Current Status

**Working on:** TheWorld.pdf integration complete across all prioritized chapters
**Partially complete:** Nothing in progress
