# Session Checkpoint - 2026-02-01

## Session Overview
**Project:** UB-CIM Study Guide
**Author:** 40-year student of both Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles
**Session:** First session - project setup and material review

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Book Structure: Option C**
   - Part 1: Why These Two Books (context, history, terminology)
   - Part 2: Thematic Deep Dives (9+ chapters)
   - Part 3: Quick Reference (appendices)

2. **Core Thesis Established:**
   - CIM is a course in Adjuster fusion from Jesus
   - UB provides cosmological framework, CIM provides practical path
   - Helen didn't know UB, so terminology differs but concepts align

3. **Key Distinction:** JCIM (urtext) vs ACIM (Foundation for Inner Peace edited version)
   - Urtext is far more compatible with UB
   - Ken Wapnick's editing introduced errors (e.g., "ego created all material reality")

---

## Files Created

1. **`my-book/outline/book-outline.md`** - Complete 16-chapter outline with appendices
2. **`read_docx.py`** - Python script to extract text from Word documents

---

## Source Material Inventoried

### Primary Sources (Author's Writing):

| Document | Content | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **UrantiaCourseStory.pdf** | 10-page polished summary with quote comparisons | Complete draft |
| **CourseUB.pdf** | 18-page "Transcendence" focused document | Complete draft |
| **UB-CIM study.pdf** | 16-page full book framework/introduction | Complete draft |
| **RevivalCIMUBOffical.docx** | 50KB detailed miracle principles analysis | Complete draft |
| **PerceptionVsKnowledge.docx** | Perception vs Knowledge analysis | Draft |
| **UrantiaComment.docx** | Introduction and thesis | Draft |
| **course2.docx** | Why both books, civilization warning | Draft |
| **stream of thought.docx** | Transcendence, mystical states | Notes |

### Key Terminology Mappings Identified:
- Sonship ↔ God the Supreme
- Soul ↔ Thought Adjuster
- Knowledge ↔ Eternal Perspective
- Perception ↔ Temporal/Animal Mind
- Holy Spirit ↔ Spirit of Truth / Superconscious
- Atonement ↔ Plan of Ascension
- The Spark ↔ Adjuster/Father Fragment

---

## Themes Covered in Existing Material

1. **Adjuster Fusion / Atonement** - transfer, fusion, bridge concepts
2. **Sonship = God the Supreme** - extensive quote comparisons
3. **Real vs Unreal** - eternal perspective
4. **Miracles and Time** - "shortening time"
5. **Forgiveness** - mercy vs love distinction
6. **Identify with Spirit Reality** - mind training
7. **Perception vs Knowledge** - two thought systems
8. **The Spark** - Adjuster as spark of life
9. **Counterparting Memories** - Adjuster preserves worthy creations
10. **Conflict of Transcendence** - both books warn of struggle
11. **World in Quarantine** - rebellion context

---

## Assessment

**The book is largely written.** Author has extensive drafts covering most planned chapters. Work needed:
- Assembly and organization
- Editing for consistency
- Gap-filling for missing chapters (UB Overview, Lucifer Rebellion detail, Ascension Path)
- Appendices compilation

---

## Next Steps (Not Yet Started)

1. Decide on working title
2. Choose first chapter to polish into final form
3. Build complete terminology mapping table
4. Assemble chapters from existing material

---

## Technical Notes

- Created Python script `read_docx.py` to extract text from Word docs
- Source material located in `my-book/source-material/`
- New PDFs added: `CourseUB.pdf`, `UB-CIM study.pdf`
