**Participants:** Joseph and Claude

## The Question

While rewriting commentary for Parallel 38 (Time-Space Belief and the Atonement), Joseph noticed that the Course's reference to "before the separation, the time-space belief did not exist" seems to imply a pre-temporal way of thinking. He recalled the UB saying something about a "theoretical beginning" and asked for research.

## The JCIM Quotes (Parallel 38)

> "The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement itself began... ACTS WERE NOT NECESSARY BEFORE THE SEPARATION BECAUSE THE TIME-SPACE BELIEF DID NOT EXIST."

> "The Atonement was BUILT INTO THE SPACE-TIME BELIEF IN ORDER TO SET A LIMIT ON THE NEED FOR THE BELIEF."

From the full-quotes source material, there is also:

> "The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time. In fact, BOTH TIME AND MATTER WERE CREATED FOR THIS PURPOSE."

## UB Passages Found via Search

**UB 105:1.5** (Paper 105: Deity and Reality):
> "To the finite mind there simply must be a beginning, and though there never was a real beginning to reality, still there are certain source relationships which reality manifests to infinity. The prereality, primordial, eternity situation may be thought of something like this: At some infinitely distant, hypothetical, past-eternity moment, the I AM may be conceived as both thing and no thing, as both cause and effect, as both volition and response. At this hypothetical eternity moment there is no differentiation throughout all infinity. Infinity is filled by the Infinite; the Infinite encompasses infinity. This is the hypothetical static moment of eternity; actuals are still contained within their potentials, and potentials have not yet appeared within the infinity of the I AM. But even in this conjectured situation we must assume the existence of the possibility of self-will."

**UB 106:0.9** (Paper 106: Universe Levels of Reality):
> "Infinity. This level is pre-existential and postexperiential. Unqualified unity of infinity is a hypothetical reality before all beginnings and after all destinies."

**UB 106:0.17**:
> "The inability of any creature to grasp what is really meant by pre-existentials or by postexperientials, that which lies before beginnings and after destinies."

## The Discussion

### Attempt 1: Pre-Temporal Parallel
Claude proposed that the Course's "before the separation, the time-space belief did not exist" maps to the UB's "hypothetical past-eternity moment" (105:1.5). Both describe a state before time-space where everything simply was, undifferentiated. Then time-space was created purposefully, with corrections built in.

Joseph asked for a more generalized version. Claude provided one.

Joseph said to search the internet for more ideas. Claude searched urantia.org, found 105:1.5 and 106:0.9 via "hypothetical beginning" search. Proposed a revised commentary connecting both texts' descriptions of pre-temporal reality.

### The Key Problem Raised by Joseph
Joseph raised a critical issue: The Course uses "separation" as a reference to Lucifer's rebellion (as the book treats it throughout all chapters). How do we use it as both pre-temporal AND pre-Lucifer separation? Joseph tends to go with pre-Lucifer separation but cannot reconcile that idea with this quote.

### Claude's Attempt to Reconcile (Two Levels)
Claude suggested the Course might use "separation" on two levels:

1. **Cosmological**: The original differentiation from undifferentiated infinity that gave rise to time-space itself. This is what UB 105:1.5 describes. Before this, nothing was separate from anything.

2. **Historical**: The Lucifer rebellion, which separated our world from the universe circuits. This is how most of the book treats it.

Claude argued this particular quote seemed to operate at level 1 (cosmological) since time-space obviously existed long before Lucifer rebelled (~200,000 years ago vs. billions of years of universe existence).

### Joseph's Correction
Joseph corrected this approach: **No, time and space are used to extend creation. It is a positive beginning.**

This was the key insight. In the UB's cosmology:
- Time-space is NOT a negative event, NOT a "separation," NOT a fall
- Time-space is God's positive, intentional extension of creation
- The superuniverses are the arena for experiential growth
- This is creative, not corrective

Therefore, equating the UB's creation of time-space with the Course's "separation" does not work. The UB sees the beginning of time-space as a GOOD thing. The Course's "separation" carries a negative connotation. These are not the same event.

### The Resolution
The parallel is not about separation at all. It is about both texts agreeing that **time-space is purposeful and designed**:

- The Course says time and matter were created for the Atonement, with the correction built into the structure from the start
- The UB says the creative design that purposed evolution also provided restraints of time and space to guide developing creatures
- Both say the universe was built to bring its inhabitants home

The "separation" question is a separate theological issue that does not need to be resolved in this parallel's commentary.

### Final Approved Commentary
> Both texts say time-space is purposeful. The Course says both time and matter were created for the Atonement, with the correction built into the structure from the start. The UB says the same creative design that purposed evolution also provided restraints of time and space to guide developing creatures. Neither text treats time-space as an accident. It was designed, and it was designed with a destination in mind. The Course says the Atonement sets a limit on the need for time. The UB says the restraints circumscribe the choice range of evolving creatures. Both describe a universe that was built to bring its inhabitants home.

## Unresolved Questions

- The Course's use of "separation" may operate on multiple levels (cosmological vs. historical/Lucifer), but this was not resolved
- Joseph tends toward interpreting the Course's "separation" as referring to Lucifer but acknowledges the difficulty of reconciling that with "the time-space belief did not exist" (since time-space existed long before Lucifer)
- This tension may deserve treatment elsewhere in the book, perhaps in a chapter discussion rather than an appendix commentary
- The UB's "hypothetical past-eternity moment" (105:1.5) remains a fascinating parallel to the Course's pre-separation state, even if the exact mapping is unclear

---

## Key Takeaway

When the Course and UB seem to describe the same concept but the framing conflicts (negative vs. positive), focus on what they genuinely share rather than forcing a parallel that doesn't hold. In this case, both agree time-space is designed and purposeful. That is the real parallel.
