## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Lead with positive opportunity, not controversy | Upbeat opening; save JCIM vs ACIM issues for Chapter 3 |
| Add fourth audience (newcomers to both books) | Broadens appeal, forces writing to assume nothing |
| Include full UB quote (101:6.17) at end of Chapter 6 | Emphasizes we can achieve fusion even in the flesh |
| Correct "lifetimes" to mansion worlds | UB doesn't teach reincarnation |
| Individual fusion mirrors collective fusion | Parallel paths: you+Adjuster mirrors Supreme+Almighty |
| Time has eternal value | Eternal values are found/created within time; revised Section 1 of Chapter 8 |
