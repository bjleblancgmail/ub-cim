## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Soul (CIM) = Adjuster (UB) | Author-provided core mapping |
| Ken Wapnick essential to Ch 3 | History chapter requires his role |
| Jesus instructed not to write | Explains scribe pattern |
| Chapter 5 as draft | Author wants to review later |
| "Complement" vs "read together" | Less prescriptive language |
