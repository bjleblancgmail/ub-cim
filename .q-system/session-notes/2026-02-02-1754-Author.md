## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Changed "none exist" to "few exist" in Ch 5 | User preference - acknowledges some contradictions |
| Rewrote Sections 2-3 of Ch 16 | User corrected: Course is fusion training, not generic afterlife prep |
| Jesus as pattern of fusion progression | His life demonstrates what the Course teaches |
| Fusion as milestone, not destination | Journey continues to Paradise after fusion |
