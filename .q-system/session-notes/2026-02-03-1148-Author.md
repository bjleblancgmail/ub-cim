## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Spirit of Truth distinction in Ch 5 | Course quotes show Jesus as Spirit of Truth, Holy Spirit as separate ministry |
| Holy Trinity acknowledgment in Ch 7 | Course acknowledges Trinity AND expands to Sonship - both/and |
| Time/learning quotes in Ch 7 | Parallel: evolution ends (UB) = learning ends (Course) |
| Reverted Ch 8 Sec 2 additions | Too many repeated quotes across chapter |
