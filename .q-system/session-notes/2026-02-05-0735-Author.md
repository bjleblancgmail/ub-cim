## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Something new is possible" framing | Revival tone without urgency; invitational |
| No author voice in book | Book speaks for itself |
| Trim Ch 6 bridge/transfer content | Ch 10 owns this topic |
| Trim Ch 13 incompatibility section | Ch 11 owns "two thought systems" |
| Keep "His brothers in the flesh..." repetition | Intentional bookending |
| Always use bjleblancgmail for GitHub | Personal project, personal account |
