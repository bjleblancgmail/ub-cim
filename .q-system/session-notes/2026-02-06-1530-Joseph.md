# Session Notes: 2026-02-06-1530-Joseph

**Summary:** Major audiobook preparation session. Completed quote attribution audit across all 16 chapters (~45 fixes), removed "source material" framing from 5 chapters, fixed a misattribution, added two new UB quotes to chapters 11 and 13, created a quote bank, built the `/q-audio-ready` command for ElevenLabs conversion, and established a no-em-dash policy going forward.

## Key Accomplishments

- Quote attribution audit complete, all 16 chapters, lead-in style for audio
- Removed all "source material" references (author's own voice)
- Fixed Ch 8 misattribution (worship quote is UB, not Course)
- Ch 8 Sec 5 rewrite (removed survival refusal passage)
- Created `/q-audio-ready` command for ElevenLabs TTS conversion
- Created `my-book/notes/quote-bank.md` with 3 UB quotes
- Added seven circles quote (UB 110:6.21) to Ch 13 Section 4
- Added religious perplexities quote (UB 100:4.2) to Ch 11 Section 4
- Added no-em-dash policy to CLAUDE.md
- Created full book EPUB and Appendix A Word doc (earlier in session)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Lead-in only attribution | Audiobook clarity |
| No appendix changes | Joseph explicit |
| Remove "source material" | Author's own voice |
| Remove survival refusal (Ch 8) | Deep topic for another book |
| No em dashes anywhere | ElevenLabs audio glitches |
| EPUB for ElevenLabs | Preferred format, auto-chapter detection |
