# Session Notes: 2026-02-07-1030-Joseph

**Summary:** Comprehensive quote verification audit across all 16 chapters and start of Appendix A. Every UB quote verified against urantia.org and every JCIM quote verified against cocreatingclarity.org ACIM Original Edition search. 20 total fixes applied (17 in chapters, 3 in appendix). All 16 chapters now fully verified.

---

## Key Accomplishments

- Verified ALL quotes in all 16 chapters against official source texts
- Applied 17 fixes across chapters (fabricated quotes, splices, misattributions, paraphrases)
- Ch 8 had the most issues (8 fixes); Ch 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 were all clean
- Started Appendix A verification: applied 3 fixes, identified 1 more pending
- Confirmed zero formal citations exist in any chapter (all prose attribution)
- Discovered recurring "..." splice pattern in Ch 8 (real + fabricated text)
- Key theological correction in Ch 10: Adjuster IS the will of God; personality has volition

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Drop inaccurate sentences vs correcting individual words | Avoids introducing uncertainty |
| Absorb fabricated UB quotes into Joseph's prose | Keeps ideas, removes false attribution |
| "barely formed" instead of "embarrassingly small" (Ch 8) | Joseph felt original was insulting |
| Adjuster IS will, personality has volition (Ch 10) | Joseph's theological correction |
| Replace fabricated paraphrases with actual UB quotes (App A) | Blockquotes should be exact |
| Fix misattribution UB->Course (Ch 12 line 99) | Quote from UB 188:5.2, not Course |
