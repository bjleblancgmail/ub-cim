## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace Appendix A line 317 with UB 181:2.20 | "Eye of spiritual faith" pairs with CIM spiritual eye quote |
| Replace #8 with Tx:5.46 | Joseph chose Option 2: "Truth is beyond your ability to destroy..." |
| Replace #52 with M:9.2 | Joseph chose Option 2: "As the teacher of God advances..." |
| Rename Appendix B | "Selected Parallels" accurately describes content |
| Add Appendix C separate from B | Miracle principles are distinct content from random parallels |
| Use only principles 1-25 for now | Source material (RevivalCIMUBOffical.docx) covers 1-25 only |
