## Decisions Made

|----------|-----------|
| Revert Ch 6 Sec 4 text restructure | Brian wanted references only, not prose changes |
| Revert Ch 6 Sec 5 new quote additions | Same principle: discuss additions before making them |
| Categorize all 134 red items before acting | Systematic approach, discuss before changing |
