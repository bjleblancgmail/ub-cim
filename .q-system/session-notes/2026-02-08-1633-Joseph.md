## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Core Terminology as prose, not table | Joseph's preference for readable sequential format |
| Soul/Altar combined, Holy Spirit/Spirit of Truth separated | Theological accuracy per Joseph |
| Jesus' Personal Influence = Spirit of Truth | More accurate header than Spirit of Truth = Spirit of Truth |
| Ego = Ego | Same word in both texts, Joseph confirmed |
| EPUB output for audiobook | ElevenLabs preferred import format with auto chapter detection |
