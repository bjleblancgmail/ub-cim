## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove all parenthetical citations | Cleaner narrative flow, audio-ready for ElevenLabs |
| Use full book names ("The Urantia Book", "A Course in Miracles") | Clarity for readers and listeners |
| No paper/chapter/Tx numbers in text | Joseph's preference for clean prose |
| Vary attribution verbs (says, teaches, warns, etc.) | Avoids repetition, matches quote tone |
| Quotes stand alone with blank lines | Separation between quote and commentary |
