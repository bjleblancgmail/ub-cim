## Decisions Made

|----------|-----------|
| Remove "Holy Spirit holds them" | Joseph's editorial choice |
| Remove "it cannot survive" | Joseph's editorial choice |
| Remove "not required to perfect yourself" | Joseph's editorial choice |
| Time is for extending creation | Reframes time positively per UB cosmology and JCIM source material |

| Mind of Christ = Holy Spirit | Joseph's theological correction |
| Remove personal references | Keep book impersonal; no author voice in text |
