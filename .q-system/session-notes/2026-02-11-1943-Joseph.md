# Session Notes: 2026-02-11-1943-Joseph

**Summary:** Committed all uncommitted Feb 10 work (40 files), then resolved a two-computer divergence by rebasing local commits on top of remote changes from the other computer. Resolved 20+ conflicts (audio file deletions, Appendix A replacement, Chapter 8 and 9 content). Pushed successfully, both computers now in sync.

## Key Accomplishments

- Committed Feb 10 session work: Ch 9 expansion, pattern thinning, Ch 17, urtext search, build scripts
- Identified and resolved two-computer sync issue via git rebase
- Resolved ~20 audio file conflicts (deleted to match other computer's cleanup)
- Resolved Appendix A conflict (kept v2, deleted old)
- Resolved Chapter 8 content conflict (kept Holy Spirit sentence)
- Resolved Chapter 9 content conflict (kept "extending creation" opening)
- Pushed all commits to origin

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Delete audio files during rebase | Other computer intentionally cleaned up outdated audio/PDF files |
| Keep "The Holy Spirit knows of them" in Ch 8 | Joseph's intentional precision edit from Feb 10 |
| Keep "Time is for extending creation" in Ch 9 | Joseph's preference for other computer's version |
| Skip tooling/artifacts from commit | .playwright-mcp, Hold Files, nul, .claude/settings.local.json not book content |
