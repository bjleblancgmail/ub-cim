# Session Notes: 2026-02-12-2239-Joseph

**Summary:** Major editing session addressing editorial review problems. Completed a full quote audit (8 duplicate quotes found, 15 cuts applied across 8 chapters). Analyzed formulaic structure across all 17 chapters. Created and applied a revised Chapter 7 that replaces mechanical quote-quote-equivalence patterns with a flowing symphony argument.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep "will of God" in ch-01 and ch-06, cut from ch-08 | Joseph preferred to keep the introduction quote |
| Keep "brothers in flesh" full long-form in ch-06 only | Ch-06:223 has the full passage; others paraphrased |
| Keep "map/walking" section in ch-06:203 | Full development earns the metaphor |
| Keep "I am in charge" duplicate in ch-05 | Joseph's choice to leave both |
| No controversy paragraphs in ch-01 through ch-04 | Joseph declined all suggestions |
| No "But Are They Really the Same?" section in ch-07 | Joseph preferred not to go there |
| Approved Ch 7 revised version | Less formulaic, symphony argument replaces mechanical pattern |
