# Session Notes: 2026-02-14-1737-Joseph

**Summary:** Major fusion-thesis strengthening session. Found 20 new Course/urtext quotes supporting "the Course is a course in Adjuster fusion" (including 2 additional uses of "fuse/fusing" beyond Tx 5.18). Integrated quotes into 12 of 17 chapters with interpretive bridges, refined through multiple rounds of editorial discussion. Generated audiobook EPUB.

## Key Accomplishments

- Completed fresh publisher-perspective editorial review of entire manuscript (17 chapters, 3 appendices)
- Searched entire urtext and all source material for new fusion-thesis quotes using 3 parallel research agents
- Found 20 new quotes; the Course uses "fuse/fusing" at least 3 times, not just once
- Saved curated quote list to `my-book/notes/fusion-thesis-quotes-new.md`
- Created HTML side-by-side review tool for chapter edits
- Integrated quotes into chapters 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 17
- Chapter 6 (Central Thesis) opening now presents three fusion quotes instead of one
- Chapter 10 (Fusion) now uses full transfer/One-Mindedness passage instead of truncated version
- Multiple rounds of refinement on theological balance (Course eternal perspective vs UB dual perspective)
- Generated audiobook EPUB (53,754 words) with citations stripped

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use full extended quotes per Joseph's direction | Accuracy and richness over brevity |
| Balance interpretive bridges for both communities | UB readers will object if Course perspective dominates |
| Course speaks from eternal perspective, UB from both | Avoids oversimplification of UB's dual perspective on survival |
| Skip Ch 3, 4, 5, 13 for quotes | Historical/reference chapters, no fusion quotes fit |
| Reject Ch 15 quote proposal | Joseph felt the quote didn't fit the Lucifer Rebellion chapter |
| Strip citations from audiobook | Clean audio, citations are visual-only |

## Next Actions

- [ ] Address remaining editorial items: structural repetition, invisible author, formulaic structure
- [ ] Author preface discussion
- [ ] Chapter 4 merge/cut decision
- [ ] Chapter 16 restructure (still UB-heavy despite new quote)
- [ ] Chapter 17 placement decision (move earlier?)
- [ ] Appendix C completion (25 of 50 principles done)
- [ ] Quote deduplication audit across chapters (Tx 5.18 still appears in Ch 6 twice)
- [ ] Verify all new quote citations against urtext for accuracy
- [ ] Consider using remaining unused quotes (#7, #8, #10, #11 unused, #13 unused)
- [ ] Rename chapter-08 file to remove DRAFT from filename
