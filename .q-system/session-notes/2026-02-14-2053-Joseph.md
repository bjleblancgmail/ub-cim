# Session Notes: 2026-02-14-2053-Joseph

**Summary:** Integrated concepts from TheWorld.pdf (Doug's 2003 exegetical work on ACIM's definition of "the world") across four chapters. Applied 11 insertions placing 7 Urtext quotes and 1 UB quote with no duplicates. Key additions: "world" as perceptual framework not planet, monster analogy, create vs. make distinction, God created time/matter as teaching device, real world mapped to morontia, turn the other cheek reframed as active love.

## Key Accomplishments

- Surveyed 7 chapters for integration, ranked by priority

- Applied 11 insertions across 4 chapters:
  - Ch 8 (What Is Real?): 4 insertions, 4 Urtext quotes (296 -> 335 lines)
  - Ch 13 (Perception vs Knowledge): 3 insertions, 1 Urtext quote (116 -> 137 lines)
  - Ch 12 (Forgiveness): 2 insertions, 1 UB quote 159:5.9 (140 -> 149 lines)
  - Ch 6 (Central Thesis): 2 insertions, 2 Urtext quotes (222 -> 233 lines)
- Joseph suggested connecting "punch as cry for love" to "turn the other cheek"; integrated UB 159:5.9

- Committed and pushed all changes to origin

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No new chapter for "the world" topic | Redundant with Ch 8 and Ch 13 |
| Start with Ch 8 | Most at risk of being misread as denying physical reality |
| Add "turn the other cheek" (UB 159:5.9) to Ch 12 | Joseph's suggestion; reframes misunderstood teaching |
| Delete monster analogy from Ch 12 | Already in Ch 8; redundant for cover-to-cover readers |
| Skip Ch 5 glossary entries | Concepts already treated in Ch 6 and Ch 8 |
| Keep remote's Ch 7 during rebase | Fuller version with both UB and Course quotes |
