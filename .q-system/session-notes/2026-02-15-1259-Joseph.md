# Session Notes: 2026-02-15-1259-Joseph

**Summary:** Completed formulaic structure fixes for Ch 13 (6 edits) and Ch 11 (9 edits), the 2nd and 3rd most formulaic chapters identified in the Feb 12 analysis. All blockquotes kept per Joseph's preference. Equivalence phrases eliminated, mechanical intros replaced with argument-first framing, repetitive restatements trimmed. Also conducted deep research on mind levels, prayer, and miracles across the project.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep all blockquotes as separate blockquotes | Joseph's explicit preference after seeing inline version |
| Require source attribution before every quote | Joseph wants readers to always know which source is quoted |
| Kill equivalence phrases ("the same," "confirms this") | Primary formulaic problem in Ch 11; replaced with argument-first framing |
| Trim repetitive restatements, keep strong pickups | "Worship is identification" kept; "The human mind does not create real values. It can recognize them..." cut |
