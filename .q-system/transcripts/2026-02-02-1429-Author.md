### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Soul (CIM) = Adjuster (UB), not Holy Spirit | Author-provided terminology mapping |
| Keep Ken Wapnick out of Ch 2, include in Ch 3 | Ch 3 is about history where he's essential |
| "Complement each other" not "meant to be read together" | Author preference - less prescriptive |
| Lucifer not immediately arrested | Accuracy - rebellion allowed to run its course |
| Helen conscious, edited heavily | Important distinction for personal revelation |
| Added Jesus quote about destroying writings | Explains why Jesus works through scribes |
| Chapter 5 saved as draft for later review | Author wanted to edit it later |

## Key Quotes Added

**UB on Jesus and writings:**
> "To the end that you may not unnecessarily contribute to the creation of subsequent stereotyped systems of Urantia religious beliefs or other types of nonprogressive religious loyalties, we advise you still further: Leave no writings behind you on the planet."

**JCIM on early chapters:**
> "This is a course in mind training. All learning involves attention and study at some level. Some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their study."
