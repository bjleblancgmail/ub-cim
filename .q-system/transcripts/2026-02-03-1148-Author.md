### From checkpoint 1145:

1. Section 2: Revised paragraph about "the Son" to acknowledge the Course recognizes the Holy Trinity and the Son's role in it, while also describing the expanded Sonship concept
2. Section 3: Added two new quotes about time/learning ending:
   - UB: "There will come an end sometime to the growth of the Supreme..."
   - Course: "The purpose of time is to enable man to learn to use it constructively..."
   - Added narration connecting the end of evolution (UB) with the end of learning (Course)
3. Section 7: Revised paragraph about past-eternity experience to clarify this is the Adjuster's memory stirring within you

**Chapter 8 Review**
1. Section 2: Added material about "your creations" and purpose, then REVERTED to original after identifying too many quote repetitions
2. Identified repeated quotes in Chapter 8:
   - "Your creations are protected..." appears in Sections 2 and 4

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Changed "Spirit of Truth / Holy Spirit" to just "Holy Spirit" in table | Course quotes show Jesus ("I") as Spirit of Truth, Holy Spirit as separate |
| Added 4 Course quotes showing Spirit of Truth distinction | Documents that Course DOES distinguish the two ministries |
| Removed blockquotes from author commentary | Only actual quotes should be in blockquote format |
| Added Holy Trinity acknowledgment to Ch 7 | Course acknowledges Trinity AND expands to Sonship - both/and, not either/or |
| Added time/learning quotes to Ch 7 Sec 3 | Parallel: UB says evolution ends, Course says learning ends - same moment |
| Revised past-eternity paragraph | Clarifies "ancient song" is the Adjuster's memory stirring within you |
| Reverted Ch 8 Sec 2 additions | Too many repeated quotes across the chapter |
| Keep "Your creations" quote in Ch 8 Sec 4 only | Natural home for identification theme |
