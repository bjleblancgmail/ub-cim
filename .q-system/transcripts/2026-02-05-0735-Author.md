## Session Work

### Repetition Review
- Read all 16 chapters of UB-CIM Study Guide
- Identified repeated quotes appearing 3+ times across chapters
- Flagged conceptual overlap between Ch 6/10 and Ch 11/13
- Created detailed recommendations for consolidation

### Audience Discussion
- Analyzed potential audience for the book
- Realistic projection: 5,000-20,000 niche readers
- Optimistic projection: 50,000-100,000+ over time
- Identified the book as owning an unoccupied niche (UB-ACIM synthesis)

### Framing Work - "Something New Is Possible"
- Explored "revival" positioning for the book
- Toned down urgency to "patient revival"
- Landed on core framing: "something new is possible"
- Decided: no author voice, book speaks for itself

### Chapter 1 Framing Edits (Applied)
- Opening: Added "Something new is possible" + "but rarely together"
- Changed "This study guide brings them together" to "This book brings them into conversation"
- Closing: Changed "Two books. One path. The journey begins." to "Two books, given within a generation, studied apart for seventy years. Now, finally, in conversation. The path is open. You are welcome to walk it."

### Chapter 16 Framing Edits (Applied)
- Changed final line from "Keep walking" to "Something new is possible. It always was."
- Creates bookend structure with Chapter 1

### GitHub Setup
- Connected repository to https://github.com/bjleblancgmail/ub-cim
- Resolved authentication issue (switched from PeerloopLLC to bjleblancgmail)
- Added policy to CLAUDE.md: always use personal GitHub account for this project
- Successfully pushed to remote

### Repetition Cleanup (Applied)
Went through 8 repetition issues one at a time:
1. "Holy Spirit is the bridge..." - Keep in Ch 10 + Ch 13, abbreviate/cut from Ch 6 (×2)
2. "Faithful custodians..." - Keep in Ch 6 + Ch 8, cut from Ch 9
3. "Human mind does not well stand..." - Keep in Ch 11, cut from Ch 13
4. "His brothers in the flesh..." - Leave as is
5. "Only as a creature becomes God-identified..." - Leave as is
6. "The doing of the will of God..." - Leave as is
7. Ch 6 vs Ch 10 conceptual overlap - Trim Ch 6's bridge/transfer coverage
8. Ch 11 vs Ch 13 conceptual overlap - Trim Ch 13's two thought systems section

Applied edits to:
- Ch 6: Trimmed bridge/transfer sections, abbreviated quote
- Ch 9: Removed "faithful custodians" quote
- Ch 13: Trimmed Section 6, removed "double allegiance" quote

### Word Export
- Exported full book to Word document: my-book/UB-CIM-Study-Guide-Full.docx
- All 16 chapters with basic formatting

### Pending Discussions (Not Yet Applied)
- Adding Adamic Default as separate entry in Ch 2 Section 5
- Adam/Eve Course reference - proposed text for Ch 15
- Rephrasing "Course does not speak of material body" in Ch 6 - three options provided

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Something new is possible" framing | Captures revival tone without urgency; hopeful and invitational |
| No author voice | Book speaks for itself; follows pattern of source texts |
| Keep some quote repetitions | "His brothers in the flesh..." serves as bookending/thesis reinforcement |
| Trim Ch 6 bridge content | Ch 10 owns the bridge/transfer topic in detail |
| Trim Ch 13 incompatibility section | Ch 11 owns the "two thought systems" discussion |
| Always use bjleblancgmail GitHub | Personal account for this personal project |
