### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep Change #8 original in Ch 7 | User preferred fuller explanation with "Adjuster's memory stirring within you" |
| Create two versions of Parallels | Condensed for quick reference, Full for deep study |
| Preserve ALL original quote text | User explicitly requested no summarization |
| Rewrite intros to authoritative voice | Match book's voice ("One is the map. The other is the walking.") |
| Add consistent intros to all 57 parallels | User requested consistency across all entries |
