## Current Session Work

### Quote Attribution Audit (all 16 chapters)
- Converted all post-quote em-dash attributions to lead-in style
- Added explicit source names ("The Urantia Book says:" / "The Course says:") to every blockquote missing a clear source
- ~45 fixes total, each chapter committed individually
- Chapters 12, 13, 14 needed zero fixes (already clean)

### Removed "source material" references (5 chapters)
- Ch 2: Blockquote about UB history converted to author's narration
- Ch 12: "The source material suggests the answer" changed to "The answer is simple"
- Ch 13: Blockquote about adjutants/ego converted to author's narration
- Ch 14: Blockquote about "nothing to fear" converted to author's narration
- Ch 15: Two instances, blockquote to narration + "source material asks" to first person "I"
- Joseph's rationale: "that is my voice, the same voice that is speaking in the book"

### Fixed misattribution in Ch 8
- "Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole" was attributed to Course, actually from Urantia Book
- Joseph caught this error

### Ch 8 Sec 5 rewrite
- Removed survival refusal passage ("When this sentence is finally confirmed... the being immediately becomes as though he had not been")
- Removed surrounding discussion about beings who cease to exist
- Joseph: "this is a deep topic for another book"
- Section flows naturally without it

### Created `/q-audio-ready` command
- `.claude/commands/q-audio-ready.md`
- Generates audio-ready text copies for ElevenLabs TTS
- Handles: em dash removal, table to prose conversion, markdown stripping, blockquote markers
- Outputs to `my-book/audio/`, never modifies original files
- EPUB is ElevenLabs' preferred format

### Created quote bank
- `my-book/notes/quote-bank.md`
- Water-to-wine quote (UB Paper 137:4), "abrogation of time"
- Seven circles quote (UB 110:6.21), adjutant mind termination at first circle
- Religious perplexities quote (UB 100:4.2), animal mind rebels

### Added seven circles quote to Ch 13 Section 4
- Placed after existing circles/adjutant discussion
- Shows the destination: mastery of first circle = adjutant mind no longer dominates
- "This is what the Course calls knowledge."

### Added religious perplexities quote to Ch 11 Section 4
- Placed in "Fringe of Conflict" section
- Full quote used (Joseph chose full over trimmed)
- "The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving"
- Bridges to Course's ego resistance concept

### ElevenLabs research
- EPUB is preferred format (auto-detects chapters from H1)
- Em dashes cause unintelligible audio glitches
- Added "No Em Dashes" policy to CLAUDE.md

### Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added "No Em Dashes" policy to Important Policies section
- Added author note: "You are awesome. Remember that."

### Pushed 20 commits to GitHub
