## Current Session Work (after second compact)

### Ch 12 Verification
- Read chapter-12-forgiveness-mercy-vs-love.md (144 lines, 7 sections)
- Verified all 6 UB quotes (all from Paper 188:5.2-5.3, all exact match)
- Verified all 4 actual JCIM quotes (all from Tx:27.14-15, all exact match)
- Found 1 issue: Line 99 attributed "Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them" to "The Course says:" but this is from UB 188:5.2. Fixed: changed attribution to "The Urantia Book says:"

### Ch 13 Verification
- Read chapter-13-perception-vs-knowledge.md (116 lines, 7 sections)
- Verified 3 UB quotes (196:3.10, 110:6.20, 110:6.21) - all exact match
- Verified 4 JCIM quotes (2 new: Tx:5.32, Tx:11.60; 2 repeats from Ch 10) - all exact match
- ALL CLEAN, no issues

### Ch 14 Verification
- Read chapter-14-fear-vs-love.md (114 lines, 7 sections)
- Verified 3 UB quotes (48:7.4, 91:7.4) - all exact match
- Verified 2 JCIM quotes (Tx:I.2, Tx:5.61) - all exact match
- ALL CLEAN, no issues

### Ch 15 Verification
- Read chapter-15-lucifer-rebellion-why-we-suffer.md (100 lines, 7 sections)
- Verified 1 UB blockquote (53:3.7) + 1 inline quote (45:2.3) - all exact match
- No JCIM quotes in this chapter
- ALL CLEAN, no issues

### Ch 16 Verification
- Read chapter-16-what-happens-after-ascension-path.md (112 lines, 7 sections)
- Verified 1 UB quote used twice (101:6.17) - exact match, correctly uses trimmed version from Ch 10 fix
- No JCIM quotes
- ALL CLEAN, no issues

### ALL 16 CHAPTERS NOW FULLY VERIFIED

### Citation Search
- Searched all chapters for any formal citation references (paper:section.paragraph, Tx: references, footnotes, etc.)
- Result: ZERO formal citations found. All quotes use prose attribution only ("The Urantia Book says:", "The Course says:", etc.)

### Appendix A Verification (IN PROGRESS)
- Read appendix-a-terminology-mapping.md (371 lines)
- Cataloged ~32 blockquotes
- Many are repeats from already-verified chapters
- Verified new quotes systematically, found and fixed 3 issues:

**Issue 1 (line 38):** "Miracles make minds one in God" - same error fixed in Ch 9. Official has "Souls" not "minds", "Christ" not "God". Fix: dropped inaccurate first sentence, kept verified second sentence.

**Issue 2 (line 41):** "The Supreme is the synthesis of creature personality and Creator nature" - UB NOT FOUND. Fabricated paraphrase. Fix: replaced with actual UB quote from 117:1.2: "The Supreme Being thus becomes the finite synthesis of the experience of the perfect-Creator cause and the perfecting-creature response."

**Issue 3 (line 314):** "The spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles... It looks past error to truth, past what seems to be to what is." - JCIM SPLICE. First part real (Tx:1.56), second part fabricated. Fix: kept only verified text: "The Spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles, because what It perceives is true."

**Identified but not yet fixed:** Line 317 UB quote "By faith, the mortal soul gains entrance..." - same fabricated quote removed from Ch 8. Needs removal in next session.

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Drop inaccurate first sentences rather than correct words | Avoids introducing uncertainty about which words changed |
| Absorb fabricated UB quotes into Joseph's prose | Keeps the ideas but removes false attribution |
| Changed "embarrassingly small" to "barely formed" (Ch 8) | Joseph felt original sounded insulting |
| Adjuster IS the will, personality has volition (Ch 10) | Joseph's theological correction: Adjuster doesn't "will" things |
| Replace fabricated UB paraphrases with actual quotes (App A) | Direct quotes preferred over paraphrases in blockquotes |
| Misattributed UB quote corrected to UB (Ch 12) | Quote was from UB 188:5.2, not the Course |

### Patterns Discovered
- Ch 8 "..." splice pattern: real first sentence + fabricated second sentence
- Later chapters (11-16) were notably cleaner
- Fabricated quotes often contain accurate theology but inaccurate wording
- Same errors can propagate from chapters to appendices
