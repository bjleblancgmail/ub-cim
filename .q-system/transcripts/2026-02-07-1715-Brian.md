## Current Session Work (after last checkpoint/compact)

### ~15:30 - Created Appendix C: CIM Miracle Principles with UB Parallels
- Extracted miracle principles 1-25 from RevivalCIMUBOffical.docx source material
- Formatted into clean appendix with Brian's commentary and UB parallel quotes
- Created appendix-c-miracle-principles.md (6,350 words)
- Structured each principle with: CIM quote, Brian's commentary, UB parallel quotes
- Note that principles 26-50 are deferred to future edition

### ~16:00-17:10 - Verified All Quotes in Appendix C
- Verified 30 UB quotes against urantia.org search
- Verified 27 JCIM quotes against cocreatingclarity.org/JCIM5/searchapp.htm
- Found and fixed 10 issues total:

**UB reference fixes (4):**
1. UB 158:5 -> 158:6.4 (Principle 5, time-shorten quote)
2. "indicted" -> "indited" (Principle 11, UB 144:2.2)
3. UB 117:1.1 -> 117:3.1 (Principle 19, "sum total of all finite growth")
4. UB 117:1.1 -> 117:0.4 (Principle 19, "synthetic cumulative total")

**JCIM reference/wording fixes (6):**
5. Tx:1.8 wording corrected to match OE ("healing. They supply a lack, and")
6. Tx:26.55 -> Tx:24.42 (Principle 21, forgiveness quote)
7. Tx:5.85 -> W1:19.2 (Principles 22-24, "minds are joined" is in Workbook not Text)
8. Tx:1.23 -> Tx:1.25 (Principle 23, OE paragraph numbering differs)
9. Tx:1.24 -> Tx:1.27 (Principle 24, OE paragraph numbering differs)

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace Appendix A line 317 with UB 181:2.20 | "Eye of spiritual faith" pairs with CIM spiritual eye quote |
| Replace Appendix B #8 with Tx:5.46 | Brian chose "Truth is beyond your ability to destroy..." |
| Replace Appendix B #52 with M:9.2 | Brian chose "As the teacher of God advances..." |
| Rename Appendix B to "Selected Parallels" | Accurately describes content (not "Quick Reference") |
| Add Appendix C for Miracle Principles | Restore from original plan, separate from Selected Parallels |
| 7 appendices total (A-G) | Brian's decision to keep both Selected Parallels and Miracle Principles |
| Use only principles 1-25 for now | Source material covers 1-25; 26-50 deferred to future edition |
