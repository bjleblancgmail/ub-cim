### Changes Made Then Reverted

Two edits went beyond adding citations and were reverted at Brian's request:

1. **Ch 6, Sec 4** - Had restructured text around two CIM quotes (changed prose, added new blockquote for "thought-transfer" quote, changed connecting text). Reverted to original prose.

2. **Ch 6, Sec 5** - Had added two new quote blocks ("Across the bridge, it is so different!" and "The only value which the body has..."). Reverted, removing both additions.

### Docx Red Text Analysis

Read Brian's annotated Word document (UB-CIM-Study-Guide-Feb6(1).docx) and extracted all 134 red-text items. Categorized them into:

- **Group A: ~85 citation references** to add to existing quotes
- **Group B: ~30 reader comments/questions** requiring discussion
- **Group C: ~15 text corrections** (comma fixes, quote splits, paraphrase corrections)

Presented full categorized list to Brian for review. Session ended before beginning this work.

## Summary

### All Accomplishments
- Added 12 citation references across chapters 3, 4, and 6
- Made and reverted 2 over-edits (lesson learned: only add references, don't restructure text)
- Extracted and categorized all 134 red-text annotations from Brian's annotated Word document
- Created organized working list for next session (Groups A, B, C)

### Files Changed
**Modified:**
- my-book/chapters/chapter-03-course-in-miracles-true-history.md (1 citation added)
- my-book/chapters/chapter-04-epochal-vs-personal-revelation.md (2 citations added)
- my-book/chapters/chapter-06-central-thesis.md (9 citations added)

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Revert Section 4 restructure | Brian only wanted references added, not text changes |
| Revert Section 5 new quotes | Same - additions beyond references need explicit discussion first |
| Categorize red text into 3 groups | Makes systematic processing manageable across sessions |
