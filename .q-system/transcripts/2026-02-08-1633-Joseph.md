## Current Session Work (post-compact)

### Appendix A Core Terminology Rewrite
- Joseph pasted the Core Terminology table and requested rewrite from table format to sequential prose
- Iterative development over multiple rounds:
  - Combined Soul and Altar into one entry
  - Split Holy Spirit and Spirit of Truth into two separate entries
  - Renamed Spirit of Truth entry to "Jesus' Personal Influence = Spirit of Truth"
  - Updated Ego entry to "Ego = Ego" (same word in both books)
  - Added intro line explaining format (Course term = UB term)
- All 9 core entries approved and applied

### Holy Spirit / Spirit of Truth Deep Rewrite
- Joseph provided Tx:5.10 full quote showing Jesus distinguishing himself from Holy Spirit
- Rewrote Detailed section with full quote and narrative explaining two ministries
- Split into separate detailed sections:
  - "Detailed: Holy Spirit = Holy Spirit / Divine Minister" (new, with UB 34:5.6-7 quote)
  - "Detailed: Jesus' Personal Influence = Spirit of Truth" (renamed from combined section)
- Both approved and applied

### 5 New Detailed Sections for Core Terminology
- Created detailed sections with JCIM and UB quotes for:
  1. Perception = Adjutant Mind (Tx 5.32, UB 196:3.10)
  2. Knowledge = Eternal Perspective (Tx 11.59, UB 110:1.1)
  3. Ego = Ego (Tx 4.33, UB 110:6.20)
  4. Will = Personality (Tx 8.31, UB 1:1.2)
  5. Atonement = Plan of Ascension (Tx 1.28, UB 117:0.3)
- All approved and applied in order matching Core Terminology list

### Quick Reference Table Updated
- Split Holy Spirit row into Holy Spirit and Spirit of Truth
- Updated Ego to Ego = Ego

### Appendix B Citations Completed
- Parallels 54-57 citations applied (Tx:14.39, Tx:30.1, Tx:10.69, W1:105.3)
- All 57 parallels now have JCIM references

### Commit and Push
- Committed all work: 36 files changed, 675 insertions, 3,617 deletions
- Pushed to origin/master (4 commits)

### Audio-Ready Files Generated
- Created Python script (audio_convert.py) applying all ElevenLabs formatting rules
- Generated 18 audio-ready .txt files in my-book/audio/
- Combined into single file: UB-CIM-Complete-Audiobook.txt (46,930 words)
- Generated EPUB: UB-CIM-Study-Guide-Audiobook.epub (109 KB, 18 chapters)
- Rules applied: no em dashes, no bold/italic, tables to prose, blockquote markers removed, citations converted to spoken form, STATUS lines removed, parenthetical refs narrated

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Author name = Joseph | User requested anonymization |
| Core Terminology: sequential prose instead of table | Joseph prefers readable format over rows/columns |
| Soul and Altar combined in one entry | Both map to Thought Adjuster |
| Holy Spirit and Spirit of Truth as separate entries | Distinct ministries deserve separate treatment |
| Ego = Ego (same word both books) | Joseph confirmed both texts use same term |
| Jesus' Personal Influence = Spirit of Truth | More accurate than "Spirit of Truth = Spirit of Truth" |
| cocreatingclarity.org/JCIM5 for all JCIM lookups | Joseph's directive, christmind.info rejected |
| Batches of 5 for citation approval | Joseph's standing request |
| Audio files as .txt for ElevenLabs | Clean format for TTS, no markdown artifacts |
| EPUB with H1 chapter headings | ElevenLabs auto-detects chapters from H1 |
| No em dashes in any output | Standing rule for ElevenLabs TTS |
