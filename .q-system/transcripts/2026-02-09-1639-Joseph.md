## Current Session Work

### Session Start - Context Refresh
- Read author-profile.md, session-log.md, last session notes (2026-02-08)
- Reviewed git status and pending work from last session

### Appendix Status Review
- Joseph asked what was left in appendices
- Reviewed all three existing appendices (A, B, C)
- Discovered outline calls for 7 appendices (A-G), not just 3
- Appendix C half done (principles 1-25 of 50)
- Appendices D, E, F, G not yet started

### Appendix D Discussion
- Discussed format for Appendix D: Key UB Papers for CIM Students
- Joseph decided to first address citation formatting across all chapters before new appendix work

### Citation Style Decision
- Joseph wants all parenthetical citations removed from chapters
- Quotes attributed using narrative introductions only (e.g., "The Urantia Book teaches:", "A Course in Miracles says:")
- No paper numbers, no chapter numbers, no Tx references
- Use full book names: "The Urantia Book" and "A Course in Miracles" (not UB, not CIM)
- Vary verbs to match tone: says, teaches, describes, explains, warns, confirms, promises, asks, puts it this way
- Quotes must stand alone with blank lines before and after (separate from commentary)
- Existing narrative intros preserved when already good

### Chapter 1 - Citation Removal
- 2 citations removed
- Verb updated: "says" to "teaches" and "puts it this way"
- Joseph reviewed and approved

### Chapter 2 - Citation Removal
- 1 citation removed
- Intro folded into narrative with "explain" verb
- Joseph reviewed and approved

### Chapter 3 - Citation Removal
- 1 citation removed
- Joseph preferred original intro text over my proposed change
- Reverted to: "Jesus makes a direct statement about the importance of the early chapters:"
- Lesson: don't fix intros that aren't broken

### Chapter 4 - Citation Removal
- 2 citations removed
- 1 spacing fix (line 51 commentary running into quote)
- Joseph caught the spacing issue

### Chapter 5 - Citation Removal
- 7 citations removed
- 6 spacing fixes (quotes running into commentary)
- Joseph reviewed each quote one at a time with sentence before/after
- All approved

### Chapter 6 - Citation Removal
- 20 citations removed
- Joseph reviewed each quote one at a time
- All approved with "strip the citation, keep the intro" pattern

### Chapter 7 - Citation Removal
- 26 citations removed using batch approach (replace_all for repeated citations)
- 6 spacing fixes applied
- No words changed

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove all parenthetical citations | Cleaner narrative, audio-ready for ElevenLabs |
| Use full book names in attributions | Reader clarity, audiobook listener needs to know source before quote |
| No paper/chapter numbers in text | Joseph's preference for clean prose |
| Vary attribution verbs | Avoids repetition, matches tone of each quote |
| Quotes stand alone with blank lines | Visual and audio separation between quote and commentary |
| Keep existing good intros unchanged | Don't fix what isn't broken |
