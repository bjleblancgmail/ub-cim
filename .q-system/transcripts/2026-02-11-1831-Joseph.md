## Current Session Work

### Text Edits (Targeted Removals and Revisions)

1. **Chapter 8 (What Is Real)** - Removed "The Holy Spirit holds them." from line 129. Sentence now reads: "Your creations... are not lost. They are protected. The Adjuster preserves them."

2. **Chapter 10 (Adjuster Fusion)** - Removed "And if your sense of self remains entirely located there, it cannot survive." from line 39. Sentence now ends: "It does not last."

3. **Chapter 10 (Adjuster Fusion)** - Removed "You are not required to perfect yourself." from line 135. Sentence now reads: "This should relieve enormous pressure. You are not required to earn your way across the bridge."

4. **Chapter 9 (Miracles and Time)** - Rewrote time/learning passage at line 45. Changed "Time is for learning." to "Time is for extending creation. We exist in time because God's creation was forever designed to increase, and we were created to create as the Father creates. But we need time because we learn slowly..." Grounded in JCIM source material about creation extending.

5. **Chapter 1 (Introduction)** - Added new passage after "Different words. Same path." (line 81): "Adjuster fusion is a moon shot. But first comes theory, then practice. First you need a goal to aim for. The path described here begins with maps drawn long before anyone makes the journey."

6. **Appendix A (Terminology Mapping)** - Changed "Mind of Christ = Spirit of Truth" to "Mind of Christ = Holy Spirit" in both the Mind and Spirit chart (line 253) and the detailed section header (line 260).

7. **Appendix B (Parallels Condensed)** - Removed the Compilation paragraph (line 782) that referenced "30+ years of personal study notes."

### Research and Searches

- Searched for "holy spirit holds them," "it cannot survive," "you are not required to perfect," "never withdraws," "miracle union," "divine will," "mind of christ," "spirit of truth," "lack of love," "thirty years," "sin equaled," and personal references throughout book
- Found and reviewed source material quotes about time extending creation (JCIM quotes about creation designed to increase, soul yearning to extend God's being)
- Reviewed .q-system/research-notes/2026-02-08-spacetime-separation-discussion.md

### Editorial Review

- Commissioned and received full publisher-level editorial review of all 16 chapters and 3 appendices
- Review conducted from perspective of senior editor at major publishing house
- Identified 7 major structural issues and chapter-by-chapter assessments
- Saved review to my-book/notes/editorial-review-2026-02-11.md

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove "Holy Spirit holds them" | Joseph's editorial choice |
| Remove "it cannot survive" | Joseph's editorial choice |
| Remove "not required to perfect yourself" | Joseph's editorial choice |
| Time is for extending creation | Reframes time positively per UB cosmology; supported by JCIM source quotes |
| Adjuster fusion is a moon shot | Aspirational framing; theory before practice |
| Mind of Christ = Holy Spirit (not Spirit of Truth) | Joseph's theological correction |
| Remove personal references (30+ years) | Keep book impersonal; no author voice in text |
