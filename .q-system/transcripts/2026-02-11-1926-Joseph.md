## Current Session Work

### Session Start - Context Review

Reviewed last session notes (2026-02-11-1831). Previous session included targeted text edits across Chapters 1, 8, 9, 10 and Appendices A, B, plus a full editorial review. Identified 25 locally deleted files (audio and PDF) as the only uncommitted changes.

### Commit and Push - Cleanup of Outdated Files

Joseph confirmed the 25 deleted files were intentional removals:
- 20 audio-ready text files (all chapters, appendices, complete audiobook, study guide epub)
- 5 chapter PDF files

Staged, committed, and pushed to origin/master.
