## Current Session Work

### Session Start - Context Review

Reviewed last session notes (Feb 9) and checkpoint (Feb 10). Identified significant uncommitted work from Feb 10 session: Chapter 9 expansion, "This is not..." pattern thinning, Ch 8/11/Appendix B/C edits, Chapter 17 addition, urtext search capability, and deep research on annihilation/survival and identity/personality/soul.

### Commit Assessment

Identified 30+ modified files uncommitted, branch 1 commit ahead of origin (unpushed). Categorized files for staging:
- Staged: all book content (chapters, appendices, audio, source material), build scripts, Marketing folder, epub
- Skipped: .playwright-mcp/, .claude/settings.local.json, Hold Files/, nul, chapter-01-introduction.epub

### Commit Created

Committed as `d92fa4f`: "Session 2026-02-10: Ch 9 expansion, pattern thinning, urtext search, Ch 17 added" (40 files changed, 8,676 insertions, 2,177 deletions).

### Two-Computer Sync Issue

Joseph reported making changes on another computer today. Initial push was rejected because the other computer had already pushed 2 commits:
- `d201378` Session 2026-02-11: Text edits, terminology corrections, full editorial review
- `175b725` Remove outdated audio and PDF files

### Rebase and Conflict Resolution

Ran `git rebase origin/master`. Encountered conflicts:

1. **~20 audio files**: deleted on other computer, modified here. Joseph chose: delete them (match other computer's cleanup).
2. **Appendix A**: modified on other computer, deleted/replaced here. Resolved: delete old, keep v2.
3. **Chapter 8 (line 130)**: Joseph chose to keep this computer's version with "The Holy Spirit knows of them" sentence.
4. **Chapter 9 (line 46)**: Joseph chose the other computer's version: "Time is for extending creation..." opening.

### Push

Rebase completed successfully. Pushed to origin. Both computers now in sync.

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Delete audio files during rebase | Match other computer's intentional cleanup of outdated files |
| Keep "Holy Spirit knows of them" in Ch 8 | Joseph's intentional Feb 10 edit for precision |
| Keep "extending creation" opening in Ch 9 | Joseph's preference for the other computer's version |
| Skip .playwright-mcp, Hold Files, nul from commit | Not book content; artifacts and tooling |
