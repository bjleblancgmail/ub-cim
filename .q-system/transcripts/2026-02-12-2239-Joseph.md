### 2. Quote Cuts Applied (15 of 18)

### 3. "This is not" Pattern Cataloged
- 24 occurrences of "This is not..." across chapters and appendices
- 23 unique phrases, 1 duplicate ("This is not coincidence" in ch-02 and ch-04)
- "poetry" appears 2 times total in book

### 4. Editorial Review Problems Discussed
- Problem #1 (Repetition): Addressed via quote audit
- Problem #2 (No opposing views): Reviewed ch-01 through ch-04, Joseph declined all suggested controversy paragraphs
- Problem #5 (Formulaic structure): Analyzed all 17 chapters for structural patterns

### 5. Formulaic Structure Analysis (Complete)
- Mapped the structure of all 17 chapters
- Identified most formulaic: Ch 7, 13, 11, 6
- Identified best variation: Ch 17, 15, 3, 1, 12

### 6. Chapter 7 Revision Draft Created
- Created side-by-side HTML comparison: `Hold Files/chapter-07-comparison.html`
- Key changes: rewritten opening, symphony argument in Section 4, duplicate quotes removed/paraphrased
- Joseph removed the proposed "But Are They Really the Same?" section

---

## Current Session Work (after auto-compact)

### Quote Verification for Ch 7 Revision
- Joseph asked if "Sonship is the sum of all the souls God created" and "Supreme is the sum total of all finite growth" are used elsewhere in the book
- Found: "sum of all souls" appears 3 times in Ch 7 only; "sum total of all finite growth" appears in Ch 7 (2x) and Appendix C (2x)
- Confirmed the revised Ch 7 uses both quotes but woven into prose (Section 4 symphony argument) instead of separate blockquotes

### Chapter 7 Revision Approved and Applied
- Joseph approved the revised Ch 7: "ok use this revised ch 7"
- Saved original chapter to `Hold Files/chapter-07-sonship-supreme-ORIGINAL.md`
- Applied revised version to `my-book/chapters/chapter-07-sonship-supreme.md`
- Key changes in applied revision:
  - Section 1: Opens with apparent difference, not "They are the same concept"
  - Section 4: Completely rewritten as symphony argument with quotes woven into flowing prose
  - Section 5: Tightened, removed duplicate UB quote
  - Section 6: Duplicate UB blockquote paraphrased instead of repeated
  - Section 7: Removed one redundant equivalence paragraph
  - Section 8: Removed one redundant UB blockquote

|----------|-----------|
| Keep "will of God" in ch-01 and ch-06, cut from ch-08 | Joseph preferred to keep the introduction quote |
| Keep "brothers in flesh" full long-form in ch-06 only | Ch-06:223 has the full passage; others paraphrased |
| Keep "map/walking" section in ch-06:203 | Full development earns the metaphor |
| Keep "I am in charge" duplicate in ch-05 | Joseph's choice to leave both |
| No controversy paragraphs added to ch-01 through ch-04 | Joseph declined all suggestions |
| No "But Are They Really the Same?" section in ch-07 | Joseph preferred not to go there |
| Approved Ch 7 revised version | Less formulaic, quotes woven into argument not displayed mechanically |
