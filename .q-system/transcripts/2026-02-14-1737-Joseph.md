## Prior Work (from checkpoint and conversation summary)

### From checkpoint 2026-02-14-checkpoint.md:

1. Listed all 6 checkpoints from `.q-system/checkpoints/` directory
2. Retrieved and displayed the Feb 11 editorial review
3. Completed a fresh, comprehensive editorial review of the entire manuscript from a publisher's perspective. Read all 17 chapters and 3 appendices in full.
   - What improved since Feb 11: Ch 17 excellent, attribution style clean, Appendix A rewritten
   - Five remaining problems: structural repetition, invisible author, formulaic structure, thin practical guidance, incomplete Appendix C
   - Three structural recommendations: merge/cut Ch 4, restructure Ch 16, move Ch 17 earlier
4. Launched 3 parallel research agents to search urtext, source PDFs, and Scrivener projects for new Course fusion-thesis quotes
5. Found 20 compelling new quotes supporting "the Course is a course in Adjuster fusion," including two additional uses of the word "fuse/fusing" beyond Tx 5.18

## Current Session Work (post-compact)

### Presented Fusion Quotes to Joseph
Curated and presented the 20 new quotes in three tiers: Tier 1 (strongest, explicit fusion language), Tier 2 (strong, mechanism of fusion), Tier 3 (supporting, identity/will-oneness/indwelling).

### Saved Fusion Quotes to File
Created `my-book/notes/fusion-thesis-quotes-new.md` with all 20 quotes, organized by tier with interpretive notes.

### Created Quote Placement Map
Mapped all 20 quotes to specific chapters based on thematic fit. Identified Ch 6 (Central Thesis) and Ch 10 (Adjuster Fusion) as the biggest upgrade targets.

### Created HTML Side-by-Side Review
Created `my-book/notes/chapter-edits-review.html` showing current vs proposed text for each chapter. Red/green color coding. Updated progressively as each chapter was reviewed.

### Integrated Quotes Chapter by Chapter

**Chapter 1 (Introduction):** Added Quote #17 ("When the will of the Sonship and the Father are one, their perfect accord IS Heaven") to the thesis section.

**Chapter 2 (UB Overview):** Added Quote #16 ("God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it") to Thought Adjuster paragraph and Quote #5 ("Oh come ye faithful, to the holy union of the Father and Son in YOU!") to Fusion paragraph.

**Chapter 6 (Central Thesis):** Major upgrade. Opening now presents THREE Course passages using "fuse/fusing" instead of one (Tx 5.18 alone). Added Quotes #1 (wills fuse, Ch 7), #2 (gentle fusing, Ch 14, full extended version), and #4 (He wills you HIMSELF, Ch 8) to Section 4.

**Chapter 7 (Sonship/Supreme):** Added Quote #9 (mutual completion, full extended version) to Section 6. Joseph provided the full quote including "His inability to forget and your ability to remember."

**Chapter 8 (What Is Real):** Added Quote #11 ("You are the Will of God") and the "empty shell" quote from urtext ("He can create an empty shell, but he DOES NOT create nothing at all"). Multiple rounds of refinement on interpretive bridge to balance Course's eternal perspective with UB's dual perspective (eternal + temporal). Added "Nothing of survival value is ever lost" quote.

**Chapter 9 (Miracles and Time):** Added Quote #19 ("every collapse of time brings all men closer to the ultimate RELEASE from time, in which the Son and the Father ARE one") to the closing, connecting miracles to fusion.

**Chapter 10 (Adjuster Fusion):** Replaced truncated transfer quote with the full passage including "One-Mindedness," "transfer," and "carried over." Added Quote #3 (full version: "The new perspective you will gain from crossing over... you gave up nothing!") to Section 6.

**Chapter 11 (Identify with Spirit):** Added Quote #18 ("Your ego and your Soul will never be co-creators, but your Soul and YOUR Creator will ALWAYS be") to Section 3 and Quote #15 ("Salvation is right-mindedness which is NOT the one-mindedness of the Soul") to Section 5.

**Chapter 12 (Forgiveness):** Added Quote #6 ("Separation is overcome by union. It CANNOT be overcome by separating") to closing, connecting forgiveness to fusion.

**Chapter 14 (Fear vs Love):** Added accurate urtext quote ("You have escaped from fear to peace... let yourself be one with something beyond it") to closing. Joseph corrected the quote accuracy through multiple revisions.

**Chapter 16 (Ascension Path):** Added Quote #20 (full version: "There is a place in you where this whole world has been forgotten... your Identity abides in Them") to closing. Balances the UB-heavy chapter.

**Chapter 17 (Honest Question):** Added Quote #12 ("your will and God's CANNOT be out of accord because they ARE one") to Section 6, connecting the honest question back to will-oneness.

### Chapters Skipped
- Ch 3 (historical, no quotes fit)
- Ch 4 (deferred, editorial review recommends cutting/merging)
- Ch 5 (terminology reference, no quotes fit)
- Ch 13 (no quotes mapped)
- Ch 15 (proposed quote rejected by Joseph)

### Generated Audiobook EPUB
Updated `generate_audiobook_epub.py` to strip citations from all quotes. Generated new EPUB at `my-book/audio/UB-CIM-Study-Guide-Audiobook.epub`. 53,754 total words across 17 chapters and 3 appendices.

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use full extended quotes when Joseph provides them | Accuracy and richness over brevity |
| Balance interpretive bridges for UB and Course perspectives | UB community will object if Course perspective dominates |
| Course speaks from eternal perspective, UB from both | Theological accuracy, avoids oversimplification |
| Reject Quote #7 for Ch 15 (Lucifer Rebellion) | Joseph felt it didn't fit |
| Strip citations from audiobook quotes | Clean audio experience, citations are visual |
| Use "empty shell" quote verbatim from urtext | Joseph insisted on quote accuracy throughout |
