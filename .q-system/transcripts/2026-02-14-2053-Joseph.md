## Session Work

### Session Start - /q-begin
- Read author-profile.md, session-log.md, last session notes (2026-02-12)
- Noted 6 modified chapter files uncommitted from prior sessions
- Branch 1 commit ahead of origin (unpushed)

### TheWorld.pdf Discovery and Analysis
- Joseph asked to locate theworld.pdf in the project
- Found at my-book/source-material/CourseUB/TheWorld.pdf (capitalized)
- Read all 14 pages - a collection of posts by Doug from Yahoo! Groups (2003)
- Summarized the document's core argument for Joseph:
  - "World" in ACIM means perceptual framework ("natural grand division"), not planet Earth
  - Two worlds: ego's misperceived world vs. the Real World (God's creation correctly perceived)
  - "There is no world" = "there is no monster under the bed" (not "there is no planet")
  - God created the physical universe as a teaching device for minds
  - The illusion is misperception, not physical stuff
  - Create vs. Make distinction from Urtext
- Identified 12 usable Urtext quotes from the document

### Chapter Integration Planning
- Joseph asked if we could update the book with these concepts
- Surveyed 7 chapters using Explore agent for best fit
- Ranked integration priorities: Ch 8 > Ch 13 > Ch 12 > Ch 6 > Ch 5
- Joseph asked whether to create a new chapter; recommended against it (redundant)
- Joseph agreed, asked to proceed chapter by chapter with HTML comparisons

### Chapter 8: What Is Real? (4 insertions)
- Created Hold Files/chapter-08-comparison.html with 4 proposed changes
- Joseph approved; applied all 4 changes:
  1. Section 1: "Unreal" means derivative, not nonexistent (2 paragraphs)
  2. Section 2: Monster under the bed analogy for "nothing unreal exists" (2 paragraphs)
  3. Section 3: "World" as perceptual framework + 2 Urtext quotes (biggest addition, ~10 paragraphs)
  4. Section 7: God created time and matter for Atonement + 2 Urtext quotes (3 paragraphs)
- Chapter grew from 296 to 335 lines

### Chapter 13: Perception vs Knowledge (3 insertions)
- Created Hold Files/chapter-13-comparison.html with 3 proposed changes
- Joseph approved; applied all 3 changes:
  1. Section 2: Two worlds of meaning from one creation, cross-ref Ch 8 (2 paragraphs)
  2. Section 6: Incompatibility made concrete (attack vs. cry for love, fringe of awareness) (3 paragraphs)
  3. Section 7: Real world as midpoint mapped to morontia + 1 Urtext quote (5 paragraphs)
- Chapter grew from 116 to 137 lines

### Chapter 12: Forgiveness - Mercy vs Love (2 insertions)
- Created Hold Files/chapter-12-comparison.html with 2 proposed changes
- Joseph suggested adding Jesus's "turn the other cheek" teaching to the punch example
- Found UB 159:5.9 quote in appendix-b-parallels-full.md
- Applied changes:
  1. Section 4: Punch as cry for love + "forgive what he did not do" + turn the other cheek (UB 159:5.9)
  2. Section 6: Originally had child/monster analogy, but Joseph caught it was already in Ch 8
- Deleted duplicate monster analogy from Ch 12, kept closing insight as one-liner
- Chapter grew from 140 to 149 lines

### Chapter 6: Central Thesis (2 insertions)
- Created Hold Files/chapter-06-comparison.html with 2 proposed changes
- Joseph approved; applied both:
  1. Section 3: Create vs. make distinction + 1 Urtext quote
  2. Section 7: Universe "of God" + 1 Urtext quote
- Chapter grew from 222 to 233 lines

### Chapter 5: Terminology Bridge (skipped)
- Created comparison HTML with 2 proposed glossary entries (#11 World, #12 Create vs. Make)
- Joseph asked if we'd already used these elsewhere; confirmed both are in Ch 8 and Ch 6
- Joseph decided to skip Ch 5 additions (redundant)

### Checkpoint
- Created .q-system/checkpoints/2026-02-14-2049-Joseph.md

### Commit and Push
- Staged 17 files (4 modified chapters, 5 comparison HTMLs, checkpoint, settings, originals)
- Committed: "Session 2026-02-14: TheWorld.pdf integration, Urtext quotes across 4 chapters"
- Push failed (remote had changes); pulled with rebase
- Resolved 1 merge conflict in Ch 7 (kept remote's fuller version with both UB and Course quotes)
- Rebase succeeded; pushed both commits to origin

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No new chapter for "the world" topic | Redundant with Ch 8 and Ch 13 |
| Start integrations with Ch 8 | Most at risk of being misread as denying physical reality |
| Add "turn the other cheek" (UB 159:5.9) to Ch 12 | Joseph's idea; reframes misunderstood teaching |
| Delete monster analogy from Ch 12 | Already in Ch 8; redundant for cover-to-cover readers |
| Skip Ch 5 glossary entries | Concepts already treated in Ch 6 and Ch 8 |
| Keep remote's Ch 7 version during rebase | Fuller version with both UB and Course quotes |
