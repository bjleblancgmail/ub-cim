## Current Session Work

### Research: Subconscious, Conscious, Superconscious Mind

Joseph requested a deep search across the entire project for insights about subconscious/conscious/superconscious mind levels, prayer, words, miracles, and practical advice. Used Explore agent to search all files thoroughly.

**Findings synthesized into 6 categories:**
1. Three levels of mind (subconscious, conscious, superconscious) mapped across Course and UB terminology
2. Prayer as bridge reaching down to subconscious experience and up to superconscious Adjuster contact (UB 91:3.5)
3. Words play no part in healing; spiritual content validates prayer (both sources agree)
4. Miracle mechanism: impulse rises from subconscious, breaks through conscious action, opens channel to superconscious
5. Practical guidance scattered across chapters but identified as potentially thin for readers
6. Key chapters identified: Ch 9 (miracles), Ch 11 (practice), Ch 12 (forgiveness), Ch 6 (prayer/fusion), Appendix C (principles)

Joseph noted this was exploratory, reading old docs.

### Chapter 13: Formulaic Structure Fixes

Analyzed Ch 13 for formulaic patterns:
- 7 instances of "Source says:" mechanical intros
- 6 blockquotes following quote-explain-map pattern
- Section 6 identified as strongest (no quotes, all argument)

**Draft 1:** Proposed removing blockquotes and weaving quotes inline. Joseph rejected: "leave the block quotes as they were, separate."

**Draft 2 (v2):** Kept all blockquotes, replaced mechanical intros with argument-first framing, trimmed repetitive restatements. Joseph then requested: "add 'The Course says' or 'The Urantia Book says' before each quote."

**Final version (v3):** Argument-first framing + source attributions before every blockquote. Joseph approved.

**6 edits applied to chapter file:**
1. Section 1: New opening sentence + argument-first lead into quote
2. Section 2: "And its limitations go deeper..." + trimmed restatement
3. Section 3: "And it is where the journey leads..." + trimmed restatement
4. Section 4: "...measurable progression through psychic circles:" + "And there is a finish line."
5. Section 5: "The bridge is the Holy Spirit, and the way to cross it is through your brother." + trimmed restatement
6. Section 7: "And at the end of that transformation, something breaks through." + trimmed restatement

### Chapter 11: Formulaic Structure Fixes

Analyzed Ch 11: 17 blockquotes across 7 sections. Primary problem was equivalence phrases ("the same process," "confirms this," "the same territory," "the same practice," "the same release") and mechanical "Source says:" intros.

Presented 9 proposed edits in table format. Joseph approved and requested HTML comparison.

**HTML comparison built, Joseph approved, 9 edits applied:**
1. S1: "describes the same process without calling it a course:" changed to "doesn't call it a course, but it names the destination:"
2. S1: "This is what both books are teaching, a fundamental shift" changed to "Identify the self with the universe: a fundamental shift"
3. S2: "The Course says:" changed to "And that choice has consequences. The Course says:"
4. S3: "The Urantia Book confirms this:" changed to "The cost of divided allegiance is steep. The Urantia Book says:"
5. S4: "The Course describes the same territory:" changed to "And here is why the ego fights so hard against the shift. The Course says:"
6. S5: "describes the same practice through worship and prayer:" changed to "grounds this re-identification in worship and prayer:"
7. S5: "And prayer, the Urantia Book says:" changed to "And prayer takes identification even deeper. The Urantia Book says:"
8. S6: Merged standalone "The Urantia Book says:" with argument lead into one paragraph
9. S6: "The Course speaks of the same release:" changed to "The imprisonment is self-inflicted, and so is the release. The Course says:"

## Summary

### All Accomplishments
- Deep research across project on mind levels, prayer, miracles, and practical guidance
- Ch 13 formulaic structure fixes: 6 edits (argument-first framing, trimmed restatements, blockquotes kept)
- Ch 11 formulaic structure fixes: 9 edits (6 equivalence phrases killed, 3 mechanical intros fixed, 1 paragraph merge)
- Created side-by-side HTML comparisons for both chapters
- Committed and pushed to origin/master

### Files Changed

**Modified:**
- my-book/chapters/chapter-13-perception-vs-knowledge.md (6 edits)
- my-book/chapters/chapter-11-identify-with-spirit-reality.md (9 edits)
- Hold Files/chapter-13-comparison.html (replaced with formulaic structure revision v3)
- Hold Files/chapter-11-comparison.html (replaced with formulaic structure revision)

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep all blockquotes in both chapters | Joseph's preference: quotes should remain as separate blockquotes |
| Add "The Course says" / "The Urantia Book says" before every quote | Joseph needs readers to know which source is being referenced |
| Replace equivalence phrases ("the same," "confirms this") with argument-first framing | Eliminates mechanical ping-pong pattern while keeping source clarity |
| Trim repetitive restatements after quotes | After-quote text should move argument forward, not repeat what the quote said |
| Section 6 of Ch 13 and Section 7 of Ch 11 left unchanged | Already strong: all argument and voice, no formulaic patterns |
