# Appendix A: Terminology Mapping Table

This appendix provides a reference for readers moving between A Course in Miracles and The Urantia Book. The two texts describe the same spiritual realities using different vocabularies — one filtered through Helen Schucman's Christian framework, the other using precise celestial terminology.

These mappings are not equations. Each term carries nuances the other may not. Use this table as a bridge, not a dictionary.

---

## Core Terminology

Each entry below pairs a term from the Course in Miracles with its closest parallel in the Urantia Book, followed by a brief explanation of how the two connect.

**Soul / Altar = Thought Adjuster / Divine Monitor**
The Course uses two words for the same inner reality. "Soul" is your indestructible divine center, and "altar" is the sacred place within where you meet God. The Urantia Book identifies both as the Thought Adjuster, a fragment of the Father that indwells every normal human mind. The Adjuster is both the divine presence and the place of meeting. (Ch 5, 6)

**Sonship = God the Supreme**
The Course uses "Sonship" to describe the collective totality of all God's children as one living whole. The Urantia Book calls this God the Supreme, the evolving deity that emerges as all finite creatures grow toward perfection together. (Ch 5, 7)

**Holy Spirit = Holy Spirit / Divine Minister**
The Course uses "Holy Spirit" as the divine communication link between God and humanity. The Urantia Book identifies this as the ministry of the Divine Minister, the Creative Spirit of the local universe. When the Course refers to the "Holy One" as a presence distinct from Jesus, this maps to the UB's Holy Spirit. (Ch 5)

**Jesus' Personal Influence = Spirit of Truth**
When Jesus says "I" in the Course, "I am in charge," "I will lend them my strength," "I lead," "I teach," this is the Spirit of Truth in action. The Urantia Book describes this as the spirit poured out by Jesus after his resurrection. The Course rarely names it separately, but the two ministries are visible: Jesus makes Atonement decisions, the Holy Spirit approves them. Two entities working in harmony. (Ch 5, Section 2)

**Perception = Adjutant Mind / Temporal Mind**
The Course contrasts "perception" with knowledge, treating it as the unreliable, time-bound way of seeing. The Urantia Book traces this to the adjutant mind spirits, the animal-origin intellect that is subject to illusion and distortion. (Ch 5, 13)

**Knowledge = Eternal Perspective / Superconscious**
The Course uses "knowledge" to mean direct, certain awareness of God beyond any doubt. The Urantia Book locates this in the superconscious, the Adjuster's viewpoint that operates above and beyond temporal mind. (Ch 5, 13)

**Ego = Ego**
Both texts use the same word. The Course treats the ego as a false identity constructed by the separated mind. The Urantia Book describes the same pattern: a self-concept built by the adjutant mind, not inherently evil but often distorted. Both agree the ego is not your true identity. (Ch 5, 13)

**Will = Personality**
The Course speaks of "will" as the capacity to choose between God and the ego. The Urantia Book identifies personality as the unique Father-gift that enables genuine moral choice, the power to decide. (Ch 5)

**Atonement = Plan of Ascension**
The Course describes the "Atonement" as God's plan to restore all minds to their original wholeness. The Urantia Book calls this the Plan of Ascension, the divine plan for mortal salvation that guides every creature from imperfection toward Paradise. (Ch 5)

### Detailed: Soul = Thought Adjuster

**Course in Miracles:**
> "Your creations love you as your Soul loves your Father for the gift of creation." (JCIM, Chapter 8, Tx 8.45)

**Urantia Book:**
> "Faith acts to release the superhuman activities of the divine spark, the immortal germ, that lives within the mind of man, and which is the potential of eternal survival." (UB Paper 132, 132:3.6)

The Course speaks of the "soul" as your true center — indestructible, perfect, divine. This corresponds directly to the Urantia Book's Thought Adjuster: the fragment of the Father that indwells every normal human mind. When the Course says to look within to your soul, it means turn attention to the Adjuster. (Ch 5, Section 3)

---

### Detailed: Sonship = God the Supreme

**Course in Miracles:**
> "They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all the Souls God created." (JCIM, Chapter 1, Tx 1.19)

**Urantia Book:**
> "The Supreme Being thus becomes the finite synthesis of the experience of the perfect-Creator cause and the perfecting-creature response." (UB Paper 117, 117:1.2)

The Course teaches the Sonship is the totality of God's creation — all souls together, functioning as one. The Urantia Book describes God the Supreme in remarkably similar terms — the evolving deity of time and space, growing through the experiences of all creatures. When the Course speaks of contributing to the Sonship, it means contributing to the growth of the Supreme. (Ch 5, Section 4; Ch 7)

---

### Detailed: Holy Spirit = Holy Spirit / Divine Minister

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity which is symbolic. He is referred to in the Bible as the Healer, the Comforter, and the Guide... As a man and as one of God's creations, my right thinking, which came from the Universal Inspiration which is the Holy Spirit, taught me first and foremost that this Inspiration is for all. I could not have It myself without knowing this." (JCIM, Tx:5.10)

**Urantia Book:**
> "The Holy Spirit is partly independent of human attitude... The ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes increasingly effective as the mortal mind becomes more and more free from material associations." (UB Paper 34, 34:5.6-7)

The Holy Spirit is the same in both books. The Course calls it the "Universal Inspiration" that is for all, a ministry already present in every mind. The Urantia Book identifies this as the ministry of the Divine Minister, the Creative Spirit of the local universe. Both texts describe a divine presence that works within the mind to guide humanity toward God. Jesus himself says this Inspiration is not his alone. It is for all. (Ch 5)

---

### Detailed: Jesus' Personal Influence = Spirit of Truth

One of the most striking discoveries in comparing these two texts is that the Course quietly distinguishes between two divine ministries that most readers assume are one. The distinction is easy to miss because the Course never names the second one directly. But Jesus himself draws the line:

> "The Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity which is symbolic. He is referred to in the Bible as the Healer, the Comforter, and the Guide. He is also described as something 'separate,' apart from the Father and from the Son. I myself said, 'If I go I will send you another comforter, and He will abide with you.' The Holy Spirit is a difficult concept to grasp precisely because it is symbolic and therefore open to many different interpretations. As a man and as one of God's creations, my right thinking, which came from the Universal Inspiration which is the Holy Spirit, taught me first and foremost that this Inspiration is for all. I could not have It myself without knowing this." (JCIM, Tx:5.10)

Notice what Jesus is doing here. He identifies the Holy Spirit as the "Universal Inspiration" that is for all, a ministry already present in every mind. Then he separates himself from it. He is "another comforter," something distinct. Throughout the Course, whenever Jesus says "I am in charge," "I will lend them my strength," "I lead," "I teach," that is his personal ministry at work, separate from the Holy Spirit.

The Urantia Book gives names to what the Course leaves unnamed. The "Universal Inspiration" is the Holy Spirit, the ministry of the Divine Minister, the Creative Spirit of the local universe. The "another comforter" that Jesus sends is the Spirit of Truth, poured out after his resurrection. Two entities working in harmony: Jesus makes Atonement decisions, the Holy Spirit approves them. (Ch 5, Section 2)

---

### Detailed: Perception = Adjutant Mind

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge." (JCIM, Chapter 5, Tx 5.32)

**Urantia Book:**
> "The human mind does not create real values; human experience does not yield universe insight. Concerning insight, the recognition of moral values and the discernment of spiritual meanings, all that the human mind can do is to discover, recognize, interpret, and choose." (UB Paper 196, 196:3.10)

The Course treats perception as the unreliable way of seeing, subject to illusion and colored by fear. The Urantia Book maps this to the adjutant mind, the animal-origin intellect that processes sensory data and constructs our experience of the world. The adjutant mind does not create real values. It can recognize them, interpret them, choose them, but it cannot create them. The source of real values lies beyond perception, in what the Course calls knowledge. (Ch 5, 13)

---

### Detailed: Knowledge = Eternal Perspective

**Course in Miracles:**
> "When the Holy Spirit has at last led you to Christ, at the altar to His Father, perception fuses into knowledge, because perception has become so holy that its transfer to Holiness is merely its natural extension." (JCIM, Chapter 11, Tx 11.59)

**Urantia Book:**
> "And indirectly and unrecognized the Adjuster is constantly communicating with the human subject, especially during those sublime experiences of the worshipful contact of mind with spirit in the superconsciousness." (UB Paper 110, 110:1.1)

Knowledge in the Course is not information. It is direct awareness of truth, unmediated, certain, eternal. The Urantia Book locates this in the superconscious, the realm where the Adjuster dwells and communicates. You cannot learn knowledge through study. It must be received from within, through communion with the indwelling spirit. The Course says perception fuses into knowledge. The Urantia Book describes the same process: as the adjutant mind yields to the Adjuster's influence, the perceiving mind dissolves into direct knowing. (Ch 5, 13)

---

### Detailed: Ego = Ego

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The ego is the mind's belief that it is completely on its own." (JCIM, Chapter 4, Tx 4.33)

**Urantia Book:**
> "From the seventh to the third circle there occurs increased and unified action of the seven adjutant mind-spirits in the task of weaning the mortal mind from its dependence on the realities of the material life mechanisms preparatory to increased introduction to morontia levels of experience. From the third circle onward the adjutant influence progressively diminishes." (UB Paper 110, 110:6.20)

The ego is not the adjutant mind itself but the self-concept constructed by that mind. The adjutant mind is a gift, part of God's creation, necessary for mortal experience. The problem is not the mind but the distorted identity we create with it. On normal worlds, the ego would be taught right perception by visible celestial teachers. On our rebellion-scarred world, the ego inflates because it lacks this guidance. The spiritual journey involves moving beyond the ego, not by destroying it, but by outgrowing it. As you progress through the circles of attainment, the adjutant influence diminishes and something higher takes its place. (Ch 5, 13)

---

### Detailed: Will = Personality

**Course in Miracles:**
> "MY WILL CANNOT OVERCOME YOURS, BECAUSE YOURS IS AS POWERFUL AS MINE. If it were not so, the Sons of God would be unequal... YOUR WILL IS AS FREE AS MINE, AND GOD HIMSELF WOULD NOT GO AGAINST IT." (JCIM, Chapter 8, Tx 8.31)

**Urantia Book:**
> "THE CREATOR REFUSES TO COERCE OR COMPEL THE SUBMISSION OF THE SPIRITUAL FREE WILLS OF HIS MATERIAL CREATURES." (UB Paper 1, 1:1.2)

The Course places enormous emphasis on will but never explains where it comes from. The Urantia Book answers the question. Will originates in personality, the unique and changeless gift bestowed directly by the Universal Father on each individual. Personality is not something we develop or earn. It is given. And its defining feature is the capacity for choice. Both texts agree that God will not override your will. Jesus says your will is as powerful as his. The UB says the Creator refuses to compel. Your ability to choose is not a product of the adjutant mind or the ego. It comes from the Father himself. (Ch 5)

---

### Detailed: Atonement = Plan of Ascension

**Course in Miracles:**
> "Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the Atonement. This process works all the time and in all the dimensions of time." (JCIM, Chapter 1, Tx 1.28)

**Urantia Book:**
> "When an ascending mortal personality finally attunes to the divine leading of the indwelling Adjuster, then has the actuality of the Supreme become real by one more degree in the universes; then has the divinity of supremacy advanced one more step toward cosmic realization." (UB Paper 117, 117:0.3)

The Course describes the Atonement as God's plan to restore all minds to their original wholeness. It is not a single event but an ongoing process, an interlocking chain working across all dimensions of time. The Urantia Book calls this the Plan of Ascension, the divine design that guides every creature from imperfection toward Paradise. Each time a mortal attunes to the Adjuster's leading, the plan advances. The Atonement is not something that happened once. It is happening now, in every choice toward God. (Ch 5)

---

## The Fusion Process

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Miracle** | Fusion / Union of will | "The miracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between Father and son" | Ch 6, 9 |
| **Transfer** | Transfer of seat of identity | Movement from material to spiritual identification | Ch 6, 10 |
| **Bridge** | Living link / Jesus | "I am the living bridge from one world to another" | Ch 6, 10 |
| **The last step** | Fusion event | "The last step is taken by God" | Ch 10 |
| **Spark** | Thought Adjuster | "The divine spark, the immortal germ" | Ch 6 |
| **Your creations** | Morontia soul | What the Adjuster builds from your worthy thoughts | Ch 6, 8 |

### Detailed: The Miracle as Fusion

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The miracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between Father and son." (JCIM, Chapter 1, Tx 1.19)

**Urantia Book:**
> "The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God." (UB Paper 111, 111:5.1)

The miracle is not *like* fusion. The miracle *is* fusion — the union of the human will with the divine will. Every time the Course speaks of miracles, it is speaking of this alignment. (Ch 6, Section 2)

---

### Detailed: Transfer of Identity

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge." (JCIM, Chapter 5, Tx 5.32)

**Urantia Book:**
> "Selfhood of survival value, selfhood that can transcend the experience of death, is only evolved by establishing a potential transfer of the seat of the identity of the evolving personality from the transient life vehicle — the material body — to the more enduring and immortal nature of the morontia soul." (UB Paper 112, 112:2.20)

Same word: transfer. Same process: relocating your sense of self from the temporary to the permanent. (Ch 6, Section 4; Ch 10)

---

### Detailed: The Bridge

**Urantia Book (Jesus speaking):**
> "I am the living bridge from one world to another." (UB Paper 182, 182:1.24)
> "I am the living link between time and eternity." (UB Paper 182, 182:1.25)

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The bridge that He would carry you across lifts you from time into eternity." (JCIM, Chapter 16, Tx 16.42)
> "The Holy Spirit remains the bridge between perception and knowledge." (JCIM, Chapter 6, Tx 6.31)

Jesus is the bridge. He demonstrated in his own life the complete transfer. The Holy Spirit — which includes Jesus's Spirit of Truth — carries you across. (Ch 10, Section 3)

---

## Reality and Illusion

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Real / Reality** | Eternal / Spirit reality | What endures; what has survival value | Ch 8 |
| **Unreal / Illusion** | Temporal / Material | Not evil, but passing; "the shadow of spirit realities" | Ch 8 |
| **Nothing real can be threatened** | Nothing of survival value is ever lost | Same teaching, different words | Ch 8 |
| **Dream** | Material existence | The Course's metaphor for time-bound perception | Ch 8 |
| **Real World** | Morontia reality | The transitional state between material and spirit | Ch 8 |
| **Awakening** | Fusion / Spiritual birth | The moment of permanent union with the divine | Ch 8, 10 |
| **Shadow** | Material as reflection of spirit | "The unreal and fleeting shadow of spirit realities" | Ch 8 |
| **Scaffolding** | Temporal experience | Temporary but purposeful; "bridged you over to the morontia level" | Ch 8 |
| **Survival value** | What is real | What the Adjuster preserves | Ch 8 |

### Detailed: Nothing Real Can Be Threatened

**Course in Miracles:**
> "Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God." (JCIM, Introduction, Tx I.4)

**Urantia Book:**
> "Nothing of survival value is ever lost in all the wide universe." (UB Paper 109, 109:3.2)

Same teaching. What is real — what has survival value — cannot be destroyed. What is unreal — what has no survival value — passes away as scaffolding. (Ch 8, Section 2)

---

### Detailed: The Material as Shadow

**Urantia Book (Jesus speaking):**
> "He frequently alluded to the natural as 'the unreal and fleeting shadow of spirit realities.'" (UB Paper 151, 151:3.3)

**Urantia Book:**
> "Mankind is slow to perceive that, in all that is personal, matter is the skeleton of morontia, and that both are the reflected shadow of enduring spirit reality." (UB Paper 189, 189:1.3)

A shadow is real in its way — but it depends on a source. Jesus saw matter as a shadow cast by spirit. The material world is real enough to walk through, but it is not the source. (Ch 8, Section 3)

---

### Detailed: What Makes You Real

**Urantia Book:**
> "Only as a creature becomes God-identified, does he become truly real in the universes." (UB Paper 118, 118:7.5)

**Course in Miracles:**
> "You who identify with your egos cannot believe that God loves you." (JCIM, Chapter 4, Tx 4.49)

You become real as you identify with what is eternal. What you identify with determines what you become. (Ch 8, Section 4)

---

## Mind and Spirit

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Right mind** | Superconscious / Adjuster-led mind | "The Holy Spirit is nothing more than your own right mind" | Ch 5, 10 |
| **Wrong mind** | Ego-dominated adjutant mind | The mind identified with fear and separation | Ch 13 |
| **Mind of Christ** | Spirit of Truth | Jesus's mind offered to us | Ch 10 |
| **One-mindedness** | Single-minded devotion | The state where transfer becomes possible | Ch 10 |
| **Split mind** | Conflict between ego and Adjuster | Living in two thought systems | Ch 11, 13 |
| **Seven adjutants** | Adjutant mind-spirits | The circuits of evolutionary mind | Ch 13 |
| **Circles** | Circles of attainment | Stages of spiritual progress | Ch 13 |
| **Mota** | Morontia insight | Bridges material logic and spiritual truth | Ch 8 |

### Detailed: Mind of Christ = Spirit of Truth

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is nothing more than your own right mind. He was also mine. The Bible says, 'May the mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus,' and uses this as a blessing." (JCIM, Chapter 5, Tx 5.9)

**Urantia Book:**
> "If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well." (UB Paper 48, 48:6.26)

The bridge is not impersonal. It is the mind of Jesus — the same mind that achieved perfect alignment with the Father. He offers it to you. (Ch 10, Section 3)

---

### Detailed: Perception vs Knowledge

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge." (JCIM, Chapter 5, Tx 5.32)
> "When the Holy Spirit has at last led you to Christ... perception fuses into knowledge." (JCIM, Chapter 11, Tx 11.59)

**Urantia Book:**
> "The human mind does not create real values; human experience does not yield universe insight. Concerning insight, the recognition of moral values and the discernment of spiritual meanings, all that the human mind can do is to discover, recognize, interpret, and choose." (UB Paper 196, 196:3.10)

Perception = how the material mind sees (partial, interpretive, filtered through fear). Knowledge = how spirit sees (direct, complete, unified with truth). The Holy Spirit bridges them. (Ch 13)

---

### Detailed: The Seven Adjutants and the Ego

**Urantia Book:**
> "From the seventh to the third circle there occurs increased and unified action of the seven adjutant mind-spirits in the task of weaning the mortal mind from its dependence on the realities of the material life mechanisms preparatory to increased introduction to morontia levels of experience. From the third circle onward the adjutant influence progressively diminishes." (UB Paper 110, 110:6.20)

The ego is not a separate entity. It is a pattern of thought that develops within the adjutant mind. As you progress spiritually, you rely less on the perceiving mind and more on the superconscious realm where the Adjuster works. (Ch 13, Section 4)

---

## Forgiveness and Healing

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Forgiveness (true)** | Forgiveness of love | "Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them" | Ch 12 |
| **Forgiveness (false)** | Forgiveness of mercy | Pardons but "retains the proof he is not really innocent" | Ch 12 |
| **Sin** | Error / Missing the mark | A call for love, not a reality to be punished | Ch 12 |
| **Guilt** | Fear-based self-condemnation | The ego's tool; dissolved by true forgiveness | Ch 12 |
| **Healing** | Soul growth / Spiritual progress | Restoration to right relationship with the Adjuster | Ch 12 |
| **Salvation** | Survival / Eternal life | The outcome of cooperating with the divine plan | Ch 12 |

### Detailed: Two Kinds of Forgiveness

**Course in Miracles:**
> "To witness sin and yet forgive it is a paradox which reason cannot see. For it maintains what has been done to you deserves no pardon. And by giving it, you grant your brother mercy but retain the proof he is not really innocent." (JCIM, Chapter 27, Tx 27.15)

**Urantia Book:**
> "The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin and all weakness resulting therefrom." (UB Paper 188, 188:5.2)

The forgiveness of mercy keeps the wound alive. The forgiveness of love heals it completely. One says, "You are guilty but I pardon you." The other never saw guilt in the first place. (Ch 12)

---

## Time and Eternity

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Time** | Temporal existence | The arena of choice and growth | Ch 9 |
| **Eternity** | Paradise / Eternal career | The destination | Ch 9 |
| **Miracles shorten time** | Elimination of time | Both books use this exact concept | Ch 9 |
| **Laws of eternity** | Eternal law | Where cause and effect are simultaneous | Ch 9 |
| **Laws of time** | Material/natural law | Where cause precedes effect | Ch 9 |
| **Now / Present** | The holy instant | Where eternity touches time | Ch 9 |
| **Time consciousness** | Temporal awareness | What Jesus maintained to prevent instant manifestation | Ch 9 |

### Detailed: Miracles Shorten Time

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The miracle thus has the unique property of shortening time by rendering the space of time it occupies unnecessary." (JCIM, Chapter 1, Tx 1.83)
> "Miracles therefore rest on the laws of eternity, not of time." (JCIM, Chapter 1, Tx 1.19)

**Urantia Book:**
> "It therefore becomes evident that any possible supernatural or supposedly superhuman accompaniments of Jesus' ministry pertained wholly to the elimination of time unless the Father in heaven specifically ruled otherwise." (UB Paper 136, 136:5.5)

Both books state this explicitly. Miracles are not violations of natural law — they are operations that bypass the time factor. What would take years happens in moments. (Ch 9, Section 1-2)

---

### Detailed: Jesus and Time Consciousness

**Urantia Book:**
> "In order to prevent the appearance of apparent time miracles, it was necessary for Jesus to remain constantly time conscious. Any lapse of time consciousness on his part, in connection with the entertainment of definite desire, was equivalent to the enactment of the thing conceived in the mind of this Creator Son, and without the intervention of time." (UB Paper 136, 136:5.5)

If Jesus conceived a desire and momentarily forgot about time, the thing would simply happen immediately. His mind, connected to creative power, could manifest reality the moment time-awareness lapsed. This is why he performed relatively few miracles — he had to stay anchored in temporal flow. (Ch 9, Section 3)

---

## Fear and Love

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Fear** | Intellectual fraud / Rebellion legacy | "Unreasoned fear is a master intellectual fraud practiced upon the evolving mortal soul" | Ch 14 |
| **Love** | Divine love / The Father's nature | The foundation of reality | Ch 14 |
| **Attack** | Fear response / Ego defense | Never real; always a call for love misperceived | Ch 12, 14 |
| **Darkness and death** | Lucifer rebellion | CIM's oblique references to what UB explains in detail | Ch 15 |

---

## Relationships and Brothers

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Brothers** | Fellow ascenders / Children of God | All members of the Sonship / Supreme | Ch 7, 12 |
| **Holy relationship** | Spirit-led partnership | Relationship turned over to the Holy Spirit's purpose | — |
| **Special relationship** | Ego-based attachment | Relationship serving separation rather than union | — |
| **Holy instant** | Moment of Adjuster contact | A breakthrough moment of eternal perspective | Ch 9 |

---

## The Divine

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Father** | Universal Father / First Source | The infinite, eternal, perfect God | Ch 6 |
| **Son** | Eternal Son / Christ Michael | CIM usually means Jesus; UB distinguishes Eternal Son from Creator Sons | — |
| **Holy Spirit** | Infinite Spirit / Divine Minister | CIM uses loosely; UB provides hierarchy | Ch 5 |
| **Holy Trinity** | Paradise Trinity | Father, Son, and Spirit | Ch 6 |
| **Christ** | Christ Michael / Jesus | The Creator Son who incarnated on our world | — |
| **God** | Universal Father (primarily) | CIM uses broadly; UB specifies which Deity | — |

---

## Spiritual Vision

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Spiritual eye** | Eye of faith | "The mechanism of miracles... looks past error to truth" | Ch 8 |
| **Vision** | Spiritual insight | Seeing through the eternal perspective | Ch 8 |
| **Seeing truly** | Mota / Morontia insight | Perception that has become transparent to knowledge | Ch 8, 13 |

### Detailed: The Spiritual Eye

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles, because what It perceives is true." (JCIM, Chapter 1, Tx 1.56)

**Urantia Book (Jesus speaking to Philip):**
> "And then, when you are blessed with spiritual vision, go forth to your work, dedicating your life to the cause of leading mankind to search for God and to seek eternal realities with the eye of spiritual faith and not with the eyes of the material mind." (UB Paper 181, 181:2.20)

The material eyes see only material things. To perceive spirit, you need spiritual sight. The spiritual eye does not deny the world — it interprets it differently. (Ch 8, Section 6)

## Cautions for Using This Table

**1. Avoid over-simplification.** These mappings identify correspondences, not equations. The Course and the Urantia Book have different emphases. Neither is subordinate to the other.

**2. Context matters.** The same Course term may have different meanings in different passages. "Soul" sometimes refers to the Adjuster, sometimes to the emerging morontia soul, sometimes to the whole person.

**3. The mapping is incomplete.** Further study may reveal additional nuances. This bridge is under construction.

**4. Watch for the Spirit of Truth pattern.** When Jesus says "I" in the Course — "I am in charge," "I will lend them my strength," "I lead," "I teach" — this is the Spirit of Truth in action. The Holy Spirit is referenced separately.

**5. Both texts are revelatory.** The Urantia Book provides the cosmological framework. The Course provides the practical method. One without the other is incomplete.

---

## Using This Appendix

When reading the Course, use this table to bring your Urantia Book understanding to bear. When reading the Urantia Book, recall what the Course teaches about the same realities.

The bridge goes both directions. Use it to:
- Resolve apparent contradictions
- Deepen understanding of either text
- Recognize the same truths in different language
- Find chapter references for deeper study

Two vocabularies. One truth. The bridge helps you see it.
