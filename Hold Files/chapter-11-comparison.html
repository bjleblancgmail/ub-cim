<h3>Section 1: Opening &mdash; A Course in Mind Training</h3>
<p>The Course in Miracles describes itself plainly:</p>
<blockquote>"This is a course in mind training." (JCIM, Chapter 3, Tx 3.1)</blockquote>
<p>Not a course in theology. Not a course in cosmology. A course in <em>training the mind</em> &mdash; teaching it to see differently, to choose differently, to identify differently.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book describes the same process without calling it a course:</p>
<blockquote>"The truly religious individual seeks to identify the self with the universe and then to dedicate the activities of this unified self to the service of the universe family of fellow beings, human and superhuman." (UB Paper 5, 5:4.3)</blockquote>
<p>Identify the self with the universe. This is what both books are teaching &mdash; a fundamental shift in what you believe yourself to be. Not the body. Not the ego. Not the collection of fears and desires that make up ordinary consciousness. Something larger. Something eternal.</p>
<p>The Course aims to lessen your identification with material reality and strengthen your identification with spirit reality. The Urantia Book describes this as the prerequisite for becoming real:</p>
<blockquote>"Only as a creature becomes God-identified, does he become truly real in the universes." (UB Paper 118, 118:7.5)</blockquote>
<p>You are not yet fully real. You are becoming real. And what makes you real is what you identify with.</p>

<h3>Section 7: Closing &mdash; The Choice That Ends Conflict</h3>
<p>The conflict of two thought systems is real. You are experiencing it. But it is not permanent.</p>
<p>The Course says you must choose one and relinquish the other. The Urantia Book says the supremely happy mind is wholly dedicated to the Father's will. Both are saying the same thing: peace comes through decision.</p>
<p>You do not have to make this decision all at once. You do not have to be perfect. You only have to keep choosing &mdash; moment by moment, day by day &mdash; to identify with spirit rather than ego, with the Adjuster rather than the fears of the material mind.</p>
<p>Each choice strengthens the identification. Each practice deepens the commitment. Each moment of peace expands the territory of the eternal within you.</p>
<p>The fringe of conflict is real, but it is also passing. You are moving through it. On the other side is a mind unified, at peace, wholly dedicated to the will of the Father &mdash; and therefore supremely happy.</p>
<p>Keep practicing. Keep choosing. The unified mind is not far away. It is being built within you, one identification at a time.</p>

<p>The conflict of two thought systems is real. You are experiencing it. But it is not permanent.</p>
<p>Choose one and relinquish the other. The supremely happy mind is wholly dedicated to the Father's will. Peace comes through decision.</p>
<p>You do not have to make this decision all at once. You do not have to be perfect. You only have to keep choosing, moment by moment, day by day, to identify with spirit rather than ego, with the Adjuster rather than the fears of the material mind.</p>
<p>Each choice strengthens the identification. Each practice deepens the commitment. Each moment of peace expands the territory of the eternal within you.</p>
<p>The fringe of conflict is real, but it is also passing. You are moving through it. On the other side is a mind unified, at peace, wholly dedicated to the will of the Father, and therefore supremely happy.</p>
<p>Keep practicing. Keep choosing. The unified mind is not far away. It is being built within you, one identification at a time.</p>

<div class="note">Changes: Title shortened from "Closing &mdash; The Choice That Ends Conflict" to "The Choice That Ends Conflict." Opening paragraph: "The Course says you must choose... The Urantia Book says the supremely happy mind... Both are saying the same thing:" &rarr; "Choose one and relinquish the other. The supremely happy mind is wholly dedicated to the Father's will." (Joseph's voice speaks directly instead of attributing, then bridging with "Both are saying the same thing").</div>

</table>
<div class="note" style="margin-top: 20px;">This chapter is stronger than its formulaic ranking suggested. The attribution phrases ("The Course is blunt:", "The Urantia Book names it directly:", "The Urantia Book confirms this:") are varied and purposeful. The only mechanical pattern is the "Both are saying the same thing" bridge in the closing.</div>
