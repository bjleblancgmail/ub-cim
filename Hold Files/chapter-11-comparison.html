<p>The Course in Miracles describes itself plainly:</p>
<blockquote>"This is a course in mind training." (JCIM, Chapter 3, Tx 3.1)</blockquote>
<p>Not a course in theology. Not a course in cosmology. A course in <em>training the mind</em> &mdash; teaching it to see differently, to choose differently, to identify differently.</p>
<p><span class="removed">The Urantia Book describes the same process without calling it a course:</span></p>
<blockquote>"The truly religious individual seeks to identify the self with the universe and then to dedicate the activities of this unified self to the service of the universe family of fellow beings, human and superhuman." (UB Paper 5, 5:4.3)</blockquote>
<p><span class="removed">Identify the self with the universe. This is what both books are teaching &mdash; a fundamental shift</span> in what you believe yourself to be. Not the body. Not the ego. Not the collection of fears and desires that make up ordinary consciousness. Something larger. Something eternal.</p>
<p>The Course aims to lessen your identification with material reality and strengthen your identification with spirit reality. The Urantia Book describes this as the prerequisite for becoming real:</p>
<blockquote>"Only as a creature becomes God-identified, does he become truly real in the universes." (UB Paper 118, 118:7.5)</blockquote>
<p>You are not yet fully real. You are becoming real. And what makes you real is what you identify with.</p>

<p>Everyone identifies with something. You cannot escape it. The question is not whether you will identify, but with <em>what</em>.</p>

<div class="section-label">Section 3: The Two Thought Systems</div>
<div class="change-note">One change: "The Urantia Book confirms this:" equivalence replaced. First two intros kept ("The Course is blunt:" and "The Course makes the stakes clear:" have personality). All 3 blockquotes kept.</div>

<p>The Course is blunt:</p>
<blockquote>"The way out of conflict between two opposing thought systems is clearly to choose one and relinquish the other..." (JCIM, Chapter 6, Tx 6.75)</blockquote>
<p>Peace of mind is impossible. ...</p>
<p>The Course makes the stakes clear:</p>
<blockquote>"Your ego and your Soul will never be co-creators, but your Soul and YOUR Creator will ALWAYS be." (JCIM, Chapter 4)</blockquote>
<p>The ego cannot partner with God. It never will. Only the Soul &mdash; the Adjuster within &mdash; can enter that partnership. This is why the choice between the two thought systems is not a preference. It is a decision about which part of you will lead.</p>
<p><span class="removed">The Urantia Book confirms this:</span></p>
<blockquote>"The human mind does not well stand the conflict of double allegiance. It is a severe strain on the soul to undergo the experience of an effort to serve both good and evil. The supremely happy and efficiently unified mind is the one wholly dedicated to the doing of the will of the Father in heaven." (UB Paper 133, 133:7.12)</blockquote>
<p>Wholly dedicated. Not partially. Not sometimes. ...</p>

<p><span class="removed">The Urantia Book describes the same practice through worship and prayer:</span></p>
<blockquote>"Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole; the finite with the Infinite; the son with the Father; time in the act of striking step with eternity." (UB Paper 143, 143:7.8)</blockquote>
<p>Worship is identification. When you worship, you are not begging a distant God for favors. You are aligning yourself &mdash; identifying yourself &mdash; with the source of your being. You are remembering your place in the larger reality. You are striking step with eternity.</p>
<p><span class="removed">And prayer, the Urantia Book says:</span></p>
<blockquote>"Prayer becomes the great unifier of the various inspirations of the creative imagination and the faith urges of a soul trying to identify itself with the spirit ideals of the indwelling and associated divine presence." (UB Paper 132, 132:3.10)</blockquote>

<div class="section-label">Section 6: Liberation from Time</div>

<div class="columns">
<div class="col col-before">
<div class="col-label">BEFORE</div>
<p>Something remarkable happens as identification shifts: time loosens its grip.</p>
<p><span class="removed">The Urantia Book says:</span></p>
<blockquote>"Spiritual volition has begun to taste liberation from the fetters of time, having achieved partial escape from time sequence, and that is because spiritual volition is self-identifying with the will of God." (UB Paper 118, 118:6.6)</blockquote>
<p>Liberation from the fetters of time. As you identify with spirit, you begin to experience time differently. The anxious urgency of the ego &mdash; always rushing, always worried about the future &mdash; begins to fade. The eternal present becomes more accessible. You taste, even now, the timelessness that will be fully yours after fusion.</p>
<p><span class="removed">The Course speaks of the same release:</span></p>
<blockquote>"When you imprison yourself, you are losing sight of your true identification with me and with the Father. Your identification is with the Father and with the Son. It cannot be with one and not the other." (JCIM, Chapter 8, Tx 8.34)</blockquote>
