<p>The Course in Miracles makes a distinction that runs through its entire teaching: perception and knowledge are not the same thing. They operate by different rules. They see different worlds. And only one of them is true.</p>
<p><span class="removed">The Holy Spirit, it says, is the bridge between them:</span></p>
<blockquote>"The Holy Spirit is the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge." (JCIM, Chapter 5, Tx 5.32)</blockquote>
<p>This is the journey. From perception, the way you see now, to knowledge: the way things actually are.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book charts the same passage. What the Course calls perception corresponds to the realm of the seven adjutant mind-spirits, the evolutionary mind oriented toward the body and its survival. What the Course calls knowledge corresponds to morontia and spirit reality, the realm where the Adjuster dwells.</p>
<p>Two levels of mind. Two ways of knowing. And a bridge between them.</p>

<p>Perception is how you navigate the world right now. It is constructed by the body's senses, interpreted by the brain, and colored by everything you have ever experienced. It is useful. It keeps you alive. But it can be mistaken.</p>
<p><span class="removed">The Urantia Book says:</span></p>
<blockquote>"The human mind does not create real values; human experience does not yield universe insight.

<p>The spiritual journey involves moving beyond the ego, not by destroying it, but by outgrowing it. <span class="removed">The Urantia Book says:</span></p>
<blockquote>"From the seventh to the third circle there occurs increased and unified action of the seven adjutant mind-spirits in the task of weaning the mortal mind from its dependence on the realities of the material life mechanisms preparatory to increased introduction to morontia levels of experience. From the third circle onward the adjutant influence progressively diminishes." (UB Paper 110, 110:6.20)</blockquote>
<p><span class="removed">The adjutant influence diminishes. As you progress through the circles, you rely less on the perceiving mind and more on the higher mind circuits, the influence of the Holy Spirit, the superconscious realm where the Adjuster works.</span></p>
<p><span class="removed">And the Urantia Book says:</span></p>
<blockquote>"The mastery of the first cosmic circle signalizes the attainment of premorontia mortal maturity and marks the termination of the conjoint ministry of the adjutant mind-spirits as an exclusive influence of mind action in the human personality. Beyond the first circle, mind becomes increasingly akin to the intelligence of the morontia stage of evolution." (UB Paper 110, 110:6.21)</blockquote>
<p>The perceiving mind is no longer in charge. Something higher has taken its place.</p>
