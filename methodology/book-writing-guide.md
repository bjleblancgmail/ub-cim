# PART 0: Discover Your Book

**Purpose:** Find the book that wants to be written. Clarify your idea before committing.

**Estimated sessions:** 1-3 (or skip if you already know)

**Who needs this part:**
- "I want to write a book but I'm not sure what about"
- "I have several ideas and can't choose"
- "I have a vague sense but nothing concrete"

**Who can skip:**
- "I know exactly what my book is about"
- "I've been thinking about this specific book for years"

---

## 0.1 The Book Discovery Process

Most people who want to write a book fall into one of three camps:

1. **Clear idea** - You know exactly what you want to write. Skip to Part 1.
2. **Multiple ideas** - You have several possibilities. This part helps you choose.
3. **Vague desire** - You want to write "a book" but don't know what. This part helps you find it.

The goal of Part 0 is to move from vague to clear. Not perfect—just clear enough to begin.

---

## 0.2 Finding Your Book: The Four Questions

Work through these questions in order. Write your answers down.

### Question 1: What do people ask you about?

Think about:
- What questions do colleagues, friends, or clients repeatedly ask you?
- What do people assume you know?
- When someone introduces you, what do they say you're good at?

**Write:** List 5-10 things people ask you about or come to you for.

### Question 2: What problem have you solved?

Think about:
- What struggle or challenge have you overcome?
- What transformation have you experienced?
- What do you know now that you wish you'd known 5 years ago?

**Write:** Describe 2-3 significant problems you've solved in your life or career.

### Question 3: What makes you angry or frustrated about your field?

Think about:
- What do people get wrong about your area of expertise?
- What advice do you hate seeing people follow?
- What would you change if you could?

**Write:** What frustrates you that you'd want to set straight?

### Question 4: What would change people's lives if they understood it?

Think about:
- What insight or framework has changed how you see the world?
- What do you wish everyone knew?
- If you had 30 minutes on a big stage, what would you say?

**Write:** What's the one thing you'd want to share?

---

## 0.3 Evaluating Your Book Ideas

Now look at what emerged from the four questions. You might have:
- One clear theme that keeps appearing
- Several distinct ideas
- Still feeling unclear

### For one clear theme:

If the same topic keeps coming up across questions, that's your book. Write it down as a working idea and move to Part 1.

### For multiple ideas:

Score each idea on these criteria (1-5 scale):

| Criteria | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Expertise** | Do you actually know this well enough to teach it? |
| **Passion** | Do you care enough to spend 1-3 years on this? |
| **Audience** | Is there a real group of people who need this? |
| **Uniqueness** | Do you have a perspective that isn't already everywhere? |
| **Timing** | Is now the right time for you to write this book? |

The highest-scoring idea is probably your book. But also trust your gut—which one *excites* you most?

### For still unclear:

That's okay. Sometimes you need to talk it through. In your next session, we'll explore further using conversation. The answer is in you; we just need to find it.

---

## 0.4 The "Would I Regret Not Writing This?" Test

Before committing, ask yourself:

> "If I'm on my deathbed and I never wrote this book, would I regret it?"

If yes, that's your book.

If you're not sure, imagine both futures:
- Future A: You wrote the book. How does that feel?
- Future B: You never wrote it. How does that feel?

The one that creates more emotional weight is your answer.

---

## 0.5 Capturing Your Book Idea

Once you have clarity, capture it in a simple format:

**Working title:** [Even if rough - just something to call it]

**One sentence:** This book helps [WHO] achieve [WHAT] by [HOW].

**Why me:** I'm the right person to write this because...

**Why now:** The timing is right because...

**Output:** `my-book/discovery/book-idea-draft.md`

This doesn't need to be perfect. It will be refined in Part 2 (Position). The goal is just to have something clear enough to commit to.

---

## 0.6 Completion Criteria

You're ready to move to Part 1 when:

- [ ] You have a working book idea you can describe in one sentence
- [ ] You feel committed enough to spend 1-3 years on this
- [ ] You can answer "why me" and "why now" with something real

**Next:** Part 1 - Prepare to Write Your Book

---

# PART 1: Prepare to Write Your Book

**Purpose:** Set proper expectations and understand the fears you'll face.

**Estimated sessions:** 1-2

---

## 1.1 The Proper Expectations

Before you start, internalize these five expectations:

### The 5 Expectations

1. **Expect this to be hard**
   - There are no hacks or shortcuts
   - If it were easy, everyone would do it
   - Good books require real work

2. **Expect to get tired**
   - Writing is draining (especially done right)
   - Plan for rest and self-care
   - Schedule writing when you have energy

3. **Expect to be confused**
   - Some advice will seem counterintuitive
   - Trust the process (like Daniel in Karate Kid)
   - Confusion is temporary

4. **Expect to feel overwhelmed**
   - There's a lot coming
   - But the method always shows you what to do next
   - Overwhelm = not knowing what's next; this method solves that

5. **Expect emotional discomfort (and fear)**
   - Writing exposes fears and anxieties
   - This is normal and necessary
   - Fear doesn't mean stop; it means pay attention

**Exercise:** Read and acknowledge each expectation. Which ones concern you most?

---

## 1.2 The Six Fears You Could Face

Almost every author faces some of these fears. Identifying them is the first step.

### Fear 1: "I don't have a book in me"

*Also expressed as: "Who am I to write a book?" / "I don't have anything to say"*

**Reality check:** If people come to you for knowledge or pay for your expertise, you have a book in you. The book is just you sharing that knowledge in written form.

### Fear 2: "My book isn't original enough"

*Also expressed as: "This has already been said" / "Everyone knows this"*

**Reality check:** Originality is overrated. A book is valuable if the knowledge is accessible and usable to YOUR audience. No reader cares if the idea is "new" - they only care if it's USEFUL TO THEM.

### Fear 3: "My book won't be good enough"

*Also expressed as: "I'm afraid of perfectionism" / "What if I put too much/too little in?"*

**Reality check:** Perfectionism is procrastination in disguise. Art is never finished, only abandoned. Your job is to write the best book you can RIGHT NOW.

### Fear 4: "No one will care about my book"

*Also expressed as: "What if no one reads it?" / "What if this is a waste of time?"*

**Reality check:** If even ONE person has benefited from your knowledge, your book matters. Focus on helping that one person, and others like them.

### Fear 5: "My book will upset people"

*Also expressed as: "I'm afraid of being judged" / "What if friends/family hate it?"*

**Reality check:** If no one disagrees with anything in your book, you aren't saying anything worth putting in a book. A book should take a position. Opposition can be fuel.

### Fear 6: "My book will make me look stupid"

*Also expressed as: "What if I get all one-star reviews?" / "What if something is wrong?"*

**Reality check:** This fear is universal. Even bestselling authors feel it. The answer isn't to avoid it - it's to use it as motivation to do your best work, then ship anyway.

**Exercise:** Which fears resonate with you? Be honest - write them down.

**Output:** `my-book/preparation/my-fears.md`

---

## 1.3 How to Beat Your Fears

For each fear you identified, work through this 5-step process:

### Step 1: Write it down
Write the exact fear in specific terms. "I'm afraid that..."

### Step 2: Assess possibility
Is this fear actually possible? What's the real probability?

### Step 3: Assess consequences
If the fear came true, what would actually happen? How bad would it really be?

### Step 4: Make a plan
What concrete steps can prevent this fear from coming true?

### Step 5: Use the fear
How can this fear motivate you to do better work?

**Exercise:** Process your top 2-3 fears through all 5 steps.

**Output:** `my-book/preparation/fear-strategies.md`

**Completion criteria:**
- [ ] Identified primary fears
- [ ] Processed at least top 2 fears
- [ ] Have a plan for when fears arise

---

# PART 2: Position Your Book

**Purpose:** Define your objectives, audience, and book idea.

**Estimated sessions:** 3-5

---

## 2.1 What Is Book Positioning?

Positioning = WHO the book is for + WHAT it gives them

Key points:
- Clear positioning makes everything else easier
- You MUST do positioning BEFORE you write, not after
- Narrow is better than broad

---

## 2.2 Figure Out Your Book Objectives

Answer these four questions honestly:

### Question 1: What will writing this book do for you personally?
*Be honest - it's OK to want recognition, credibility, to feel accomplished*

### Question 2: What will writing this book do for your career/business?
*New clients? Speaking gigs? Authority in your field? Lead generation?*

### Question 3: What do you want readers to DO after reading?
*Hire you? Change behavior? Share with others? Buy something?*

If they wouldn't pay, they're not your real audience

**Who have you already helped with this knowledge?**
Your actual clients/students ARE your audience

### The Template:

> "My book will help **[AUDIENCE]** achieve **[OUTCOME]** by teaching them **[METHOD/CONTENT]**, which will lead to **[YOUR OBJECTIVE]**"

### Validation Questions:

1. Does this North Star excite you?
2. Is the audience specific enough to find and reach?
3. Is the outcome compelling enough that they'd pay for it?
4. Do you have the knowledge/experience to deliver this?
5. Will achieving this actually serve your objectives?

**Exercise:** Create your North Star statement and validate against all 5 questions.

**Output:** `my-book/positioning/north-star.md`

Writing without a plan is like driving without a map.

### Define These Elements:

**Total word count target**
Typical nonfiction: 25,000-50,000 words

**Words per session**
500-1000 words is reasonable for most people

**Sessions per week**
3-5 minimum for momentum

**Target completion date**
Calculate: word count ÷ (words/session × sessions/week)

**Writing time slot**
When is your best writing time? Protect it.

---

## 4.2 Writing Principles

### The 6 Principles of Good Nonfiction:

1. **Write like you talk**
   If you wouldn't say it to a friend, don't write it

2. **Simple beats complex**
   Short words, short sentences, short paragraphs

3. **Specific beats general**
   Concrete examples > abstract concepts

4. **Stories beat lectures**
   Wrap your points in stories

5. **Edit for a 12-year-old**
   If they couldn't understand it, simplify

6. **One idea per paragraph**
   Don't cram multiple points together

---

## 4.3 Write Your First Draft - The Vomit Method

The goal is DONE, not PERFECT.

### The Rules:

- Write fast and messy - editing comes later
- Don't edit as you go - this kills momentum
- Your first draft should be terrible - that's the point
- Set a timer and write until it goes off
- No going back to fix things
- Mark [RESEARCH NEEDED] and move on
- No deleting - only adding
- If stuck, write "I don't know what to write here" and move on

Remember: Your vomit draft is for YOUR eyes only.

**Exercise:** Pick a chapter and write for 30 minutes using the Vomit Method.

**Output:** `my-book/drafts/chapter-XX.md` (one per chapter)

---

## 4.4 Alternative: The Dictation Method

If you struggle to write but can explain things verbally:

1. Set up recording (phone, computer, or professional)
2. Talk through each chapter as if explaining to a friend
3. Get it transcribed (Rev.com, Otter.ai, etc.)
4. Edit the transcription into proper prose

---

# PART 5: Edit Your Book

**Purpose:** Transform your rough draft into a polished manuscript.

**Estimated sessions:** 10-20

---

## 5.1 How to Edit Your Book

### First: REST

**Set the draft aside for 1-2 weeks.** You need fresh eyes. This is not optional.

### Editing Mindset:

- The book is for your reader, not for you
- Edit for a smart, interested 12-year-old
- Simple and direct beats complex and impressive

### The Three-Step Editing Process:

---

### Step 1: Make-It-Right Edit

**Purpose:** Ensure structure and content are correct

**Ask yourself:**
- Is all content in the book?
- Is it in the right order?
- Does the structure make sense?

**Duration:** 1-2 sessions

---

### Step 2: Line-by-Line Edit

**Purpose:** Refine every paragraph and sentence

**For every chapter, paragraph, and sentence, ask:**
1. What point am I making?
2. Is it necessary?
3. Is it as short as possible?
4. Is it as simple as possible?
5. Is it as direct as possible?
6. Did I leave anything out?

**Tool:** Hemingway Editor (hemingwayapp.com)

**Duration:** 5-15 sessions

---

### Step 3: Read-Aloud Edit

**Purpose:** Catch what eyes miss by hearing it

**Process:**
1. Read the entire manuscript out loud
2. Preferably read to another person
3. Mark anything that sounds wrong
4. If you wouldn't say it, rewrite it

**Alternative:** Use Natural Reader (naturalreaders.com) to hear it

**Duration:** 3-5 sessions

---

### The Edit Stop Quiz

**Question 1:** Is this the best book you can write, right now?
- If YES → Send to publish
- If NO → Go to Question 2

**Question 2:** What can you do right now to make it better?
- If you have an answer → Do it, then ask Question 1 again
- If the answer is vague ("become a better writer") → Send to publish

**Output:** `my-book/drafts/manuscript-edited.md`

---

## 5.2 Getting Feedback

### Who to Ask (only these three categories):

1. **Experienced writers/editors**
   They know what good writing looks like

2. **Experts in your field**
   They can catch factual errors

3. **People in your target audience**
   They can tell you if it's useful

### Who NOT to Ask:

- Random friends and family
- Social media (NEVER post for public feedback)
- Anyone outside the three categories

### The Gaiman Principle:

> "When people tell you something's wrong, they're almost always right. When they tell you how to fix it, they're almost always wrong."

Listen to the WHAT, ignore the HOW.

### How to Ask:

- Be specific in your ask
- Tell them what kind of feedback you want
- Give them a deadline
- Don't say "tell me what you think" - too vague

**Output:** `my-book/editing/feedback-plan.md`

---

### Professional Checkpoint

> **Consider getting feedback from an experienced editor at this stage.**
> This is recommended but not required.

---

# PART 6: Finish Your Manuscript

**Purpose:** Complete all the elements that turn a draft into a finished book.

**Estimated sessions:** 5-10

---

## 6.1 Picking the Perfect Book Title

Your title is the most important marketing decision you'll make.

### 5 Attributes of a Good Title:

1. **Attention Grabbing** - Makes people stop and notice
2. **Memorable and Searchable** - Easy to remember and find
3. **Informative** - Gives idea of what the book is about
4. **Easy to Say** - Not embarrassing to recommend verbally
5. **Short** - 5 words or less for main title

### Brainstorming Techniques:

- Use clever phrases from the book
- Use relevant keywords
- Make a promise of benefit
- Be simple and direct
- Target your audience specifically
- Offer a solution to a problem
- Use numbers for credibility
- Pique curiosity (but don't give away the answer)
- Use metaphors or symbols
- Use alliteration
- Alter a popular phrase
- Try cliche formats (The Art of X, etc.)
- Coin a new word

### The Party Test:

Imagine someone at a party telling a friend about your book. Can they confidently say the title? Does the listener immediately understand or get curious?

### Subtitle Guidance:

- The title is the hook, the subtitle is the explanation
- Almost always needed for nonfiction
- Tells who it's for and what they'll get

**Exercises:**
1. Generate 20+ potential titles
2. Narrow to top 5 and test against attributes
3. Select final title and subtitle

**Output:** `my-book/finishing/title-candidates.md`

---

## 6.2 Write Your Book Dedication

A short proclamation honoring a person or small group.

**Rules:**
- Keep it short (1 sentence to 1 paragraph)
- This is NOT acknowledgments
- Optional - you don't have to have one
- Go with your gut

**Output:** `my-book/finishing/dedication.md`

---

## 6.3 Write Your Book Acknowledgments

Thank everyone who helped.

**Categories to consider:**
- Family members
- Friends
- Editors and production people
- Coworkers/assistants
- Mentors and influences
- People who contributed stories
- Early readers

**Output:** `my-book/finishing/acknowledgments.md`

---

## 6.4 Write Your Book Foreword

A short piece written by someone OTHER than you.

### When to Get One:

Only if you can put "Foreword by [NAME]" on the cover. Otherwise, ask for a blurb instead.

### Who to Ask:

- Someone well-known to your audience
- Someone you have a real relationship with
- Someone willing to put their name on your book

### How to Get It Written:

**Option 1:** They write it (rare)

**Option 2:** Letter to reader format (easier for them)

**Option 3:** Interview method
1. Interview them by phone
2. Transcribe the interview
3. Write it up
4. Get their approval

### Length: 500 words maximum

### Important: Start early - people take forever!

**Output:** `my-book/finishing/foreword.md`

---

## 6.5 How to Get Incredible Blurbs

Endorsement quotes for your book.

### What Blurbs Do:

- Signal the book is important
- Provide social proof
- Help readers see relevance
- Convince people to buy

**Note:** Nice to have, not must have. Better none than bad ones.

### Three Types:

1. Quotes from credible/high-status people
2. Press mentions
3. Reader/customer testimonials

### Who to Ask:

- Known to your audience OR has impressive title
- You already have a relationship with them

If you don't know them, don't ask.

### The Secret:

Most people don't read the book - they approve a blurb YOU write.

### Email Template:

```
[NAME],

I'm writing to ask if you'd provide a blurb for my upcoming book, [TITLE].

It would mean a great deal to me. [SPECIFIC REASON]

I've attached the manuscript if you'd like to read it.

I value your time, so here are 2-3 example blurbs you could approve or edit:

[BLURB 1]
[BLURB 2]
[BLURB 3]
```

**Pro tip:** Have them blurb YOU as a person, not the book - easier for them.

**Output:** `my-book/finishing/blurbs.md`

---

# PART 8: Publish Your Book

**Purpose:** Choose your publishing path and get your book into the world.

**Estimated sessions:** 3-5

---

## 8.1 How to Pick the Right Publishing Option

### The Three Options:

---

### Option 1: Traditional Publishing

**What it is:** Sell rights to a publisher for an advance

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Ownership | Publisher owns print license |
| Royalty | 15% hardcover, 7.5% paperback |
| Advance | Usually $100k+ (if they want you) |
| Time | 12-36 months |

**Advantages:**
- Monetary advance
- Highest potential for mainstream media
- Social signaling
- Bookstore placement

**Disadvantages:**
- Very hard to get (<1% accepted)
- Loss of ownership and control
- Loss of marketing control
- Long timeline

**When to choose:**
- You need the advance money
- You MUST have mainstream media (NYT, WSJ)
- You want the social signal of being "picked"

**Reality check:** Publishers only want you if you already have 25k+ presales guaranteed.

---

### Option 2: Self-Publishing

**What it is:** You retain ownership and manage the process

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Ownership | You own everything |
| Royalty | 40-100% |
| Advance | None |
| Time | As fast as you want |

**Advantages:**
- Full ownership and royalties
- Complete creative control
- Total marketing control
- Fast to market

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires time or money to do professionally
- If done poorly, looks amateur

**When to choose:**
- You want control
- You can invest to do it professionally
- You don't need an advance

**Key question:** Can you do a professional job? If yes, this is usually best.

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Publishing

**What it is:** A mix that offers the worst of both worlds

> **AVOID** - Hybrid publishing is generally a terrible deal for authors.

**Why:**
- No advance but they still take royalties
- Loss of control without benefits
- Often try to take rights they shouldn't
