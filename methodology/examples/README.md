# Real-World Examples

These examples are from the actual book project "Finding God: A Companion to the Inward Journey" by Gabriel Rymberg, who completed the 2.5-year journey from idea to published book.

Seeing real examples is often more valuable than instructions alone. Use these as reference for what good outputs look like at each phase.
