## The Template

```
Subject: Would you provide an endorsement for my book?

Hey [NAME],

I'm writing to ask if you'd provide an endorsement for my upcoming book.
It would mean a great deal to me. [Insert specific reason why, based on
your relationship].

My book is not quite finished yet, but I'm asking you now, so we can
publish on schedule. I have attached a sample chapter, so you can get
a sense for what it's about.

Given that you won't be able to read the full book to comment on it,
I would be happy with a general endorsement of me. This is fairly
common for books.

I highly value your time, so I provided a sample blurb for you. Feel
free to approve it, or change it in any way you'd like that reflects
your feelings. My only ask is that you get back to me by [Insert Due
Date] so we can keep our publishing plan on schedule.

[Insert sample blurb]

Thank you so much for the support, and can't wait to share the book
with you when it's ready.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
```

## Key Elements

### 1. Be specific about why you're asking them

Don't just send a generic request. Reference your relationship:
- "You were my mentor during..."
- "We worked together on..."
- "Your work on [topic] has influenced my thinking..."

### 2. Make it easy

- Provide a sample chapter (not the whole book)
- Write a draft blurb for them to approve/modify
- Give a clear deadline

### 3. Lower the bar

"A general endorsement of me" removes the pressure of them needing to read and evaluate your entire book. Many endorsements are about the author, not the specific content.

### 4. Be professional about timing

You're asking early (before the book is done) so you can include blurbs in the first printing. This is standard practice.

## Sample Blurbs to Provide

Give them something to react to. Examples:

**For a colleague:**
> "[Author Name] brings a rare combination of [quality] and [quality] to everything they do. This book is no exception."

**For a thought leader in your field:**
> "[Author Name]'s insights on [topic] have helped countless professionals. In this book, they share the wisdom that has made them a trusted voice in [field]."

**For someone who knows your story:**
> "I've watched [Author Name] live through the transformation they describe in this book. Their journey is authentic, and their insights are hard-won."

## Who to Ask

- Colleagues who respect your work
- Mentors and advisors
- People you've helped professionally
- Authors of books in your space (if you have a connection)
- Thought leaders in your field
- Anyone with credibility who knows you

**Don't ask:**
- People who don't know you
- People who would say yes but won't follow through
- People whose endorsement wouldn't mean anything to your audience

---

## How Many to Request

Ask 15-20 people to get 5-10 usable blurbs.

Not everyone will respond. Some will say no. Some will miss the deadline. Build in buffer.

## Tracking

Create a simple spreadsheet:

| Name | Date Sent | Sample Blurb | Due Date | Status | Final Blurb |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| | | | | | |

Follow up once if you don't hear back. After two attempts, move on.
