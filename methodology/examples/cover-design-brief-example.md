## The Brief

### Primary Emotion to Evoke

**Hope**

*What feeling should the reader get when they see the cover?*

---

### Concepts and Imagery

Gabriel sent two photos of the Negev desert. Key direction:
- Calm, muted colors
- **Simplicity is the main thing** - the path to Finding God is the most important element
- Classic, clean, minimalistic
- Gender-neutral

*What visual elements capture your book's essence?*

---

### Style Direction

**Likes:**
- Soft colors
- Minimal, uncluttered design
- "It goes to the point. Which is what my book is trying to convey - Finding God is the point. No human life will ever achieve its fullest potential without that first."

**Dislikes:**
- Hand-drawn style (too cluttered)
- Photo-heavy covers (not about the author)
- Type-driven/complicated designs

*What covers do you admire? What covers turn you off?*

---

### Key Words

- Minimalist
- Clear
- Simple
- Classic (eternal)

*What 3-5 words describe the visual feel you want?*

---

### Provided Imagery

Gabriel provided:
- Two desert landscape photos (Negev desert)
- One was too pixelated/dark (rejected)
- One worked well (approved for use)

*Do you have photos, images, or visual references to share?*

## How to Create Your Own Brief

### 1. Start with emotion

What should someone FEEL when they see your cover? Pick one primary emotion:
- Hope
- Curiosity
- Calm
- Urgency
- Transformation
- Power
- Warmth

### 2. Gather reference covers

Find 5-10 book covers you love. Note what you like about each:
- Color palette
- Typography style
- Use of imagery
- Overall composition
- How it sits on a shelf

### 3. Note what you don't want

Equally important: what turns you off? Be specific:
- "Too busy"
- "Too corporate"
- "Too feminine/masculine"
- "Too trendy (will date quickly)"

### 4. Define key words

Pick 3-5 words that describe the visual identity:
- Modern or classic?
- Bold or subtle?
- Warm or cool?
- Simple or detailed?
- Serious or playful?

### 5. Provide imagery if you have it

If you have photos, illustrations, or visual elements that could be used or inspire the design, share them. Even if they're not perfect, they communicate your vision.

## Working with the Designer

1. **Share the brief** - Don't make them guess
2. **Request 2-3 concepts** - See different directions
3. **Give specific feedback** - "The blue feels too cold" not "I don't like it"
4. **Trust their expertise** - They know what works at thumbnail size
5. **Get outside opinions** - Show to people in your target audience
6. **Remember the shelf test** - Will it stand out in a grid of other books?

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Too many ideas** - Pick ONE direction
- **Trying to show everything** - The cover isn't a summary
- **Personal preference over market fit** - You're not the buyer
- **Ignoring genre conventions** - Readers expect certain signals
- **Settling too fast** - Good covers take iteration
