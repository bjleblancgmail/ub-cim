## The Fear-Solving Framework

For each fear, work through these questions:

1. **What are you afraid might happen?** (Name the fear specifically)
2. **Consequences** - If this fear came true, what would happen?
3. **Plan** - What can you do to prevent or reduce the impact?
4. **Energy** - Can you use this fear as motivation?
5. **Benefit to me** - If I write this book, what do I gain?
6. **Who else is helped?** - Who benefits from my book?
7. **What if I quit?** - What happens if I don't write it?
8. **Decide** - Am I writing it? Yes or no.

## Why This Exercise Works

### 1. Naming the fear reduces its power

When a fear lives only in your head, it's a vague monster. Writing "I'm afraid I don't have good enough English" makes it concrete and addressable.

### 2. Consequences are usually survivable

Notice how the "consequences" column reveals that most fears, even if they came true, wouldn't be catastrophic. Embarrassment isn't death.

### 3. Plans exist for every fear

Every fear on this list has some kind of mitigation. "I won't get up" → "Ask Sandra to kick me out of bed." The fear feels less overwhelming when there's a plan.

### 4. The "What if I quit" column matters

This column often holds the real motivation. "Many people like me will not be helped" cuts deeper than "I will feel proud."

### 5. The final decision is binary

Yes or no. After all the analysis, you decide: Am I doing this? Gabriel wrote "YES" for every fear. That's commitment.
