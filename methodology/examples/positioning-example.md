## Book Objectives

### What will writing this book do for me?

This book is for a reader that feels something is "wrong" with their life. It's not simply that they're "not happy". It is a deeper, nagging feeling (like a "hole"). The reader may not understand or know what the "cause" of this discontent is. They can't seem to quite pinpoint what is "wrong". To the extent that they tried to "solve" this "problem", they were unsuccessful in making a meaningful, lasting change.

**I'd like this person to realize that:**

- They are not "crazy". This phase of life and the associated feelings are a natural phase in our evolution.
- They are not alone. While they may not be aware or know of others who are facing similar challenges, there are, in fact, many others who are.
- There are not only many others who felt the same way; there are many others who know why and how to move forward.
- There is always hope for those who ask for help and open themselves for the guidance, answers and help that will always arrive - and this book is exactly an answer to their "prayer".
- While this may not be a comfortable or pleasant experience, it is, in fact, a "blessing in disguise". Questioning and being aware that something is not working is a great starting point for change.
- There are no coincidences. There is a very good reason the reader is reading this book, and will receive many other forms of help - the reader has asked for it.

**The premise of the book:** The main reason we feel unfulfilled in our lives is because we are disconnected from God and our life's purpose.

### What this book will do for my career/impact

- Reach tens of thousands of "successful" women and men that feel "unhappy" and have no idea why or what to do with this feeling
- Within 3 years of publication, receive 1,000 emails from readers who have been helped by the book
- Connect to others who will serve as my own "Whos" in the next phase of my life and service projects
- Within 3 years of publication, make 10 high-quality connections with other "whos" for service projects

### What does success look like?

I will celebrate when I get the first "thank you email."

## Target Audience

### Who is my primary audience?

Professionals that consider themselves successful, 35 and older, who have had some life experience, and have fulfilled many of their material desires. Despite their success, they still feel frustrated, unsatisfied and are unable to articulate what causes them to feel they cannot fill a "hole inside".

**Psychographics:** Cares about being successful.

### Ideal Reader Avatar

**Name:** Gabriel (me in 2006, age 37)

Gabriel, a 37 year old male, is married to his teen sweetheart and has two beautiful children. Gabriel earned a BSc and an MBA. He is curious and well-read and has travelled to a certain degree. He has a high-responsibility job as a project manager for a major corporation - a charge he was asked to take by people who admired his skills. Gabriel lives in a beautiful house and drives the latest model car. He is making a 6 figure salary and has ideas to set up his own company.

### What pain is this person experiencing?

Gabriel is feeling anxious. He is looking forward to the next experience that may alleviate the feeling - a vacation to an exotic destination, another gadget, a trip abroad? He doesn't have patience towards his wife and children - he wants to be left alone in peace. He cannot share this feeling with his wife - he knows she will not understand him.

At work, he is out of his comfort zone - he is asked to do something he has no idea how to do and that is very stressful. He is afraid they will find out he is not as good as they think, and fire him. The fear of failure is paralyzing him and his pride prevents him from asking for help.

Gabriel is unaware of his purpose, and is wandering through life being carried by life. Furthermore, the idea that someone, and actually everyone HAS a purpose hasn't even crossed his mind yet. His peers, friends and family members are not asking themselves this question either. And when a big crisis hits - the 2006 war with Lebanon - Gabriel is drowning, and finally the "hole" in his chest becomes so painful that he cannot breathe.

### What benefit will they get from reading?

- Gabriel will feel an immense sense of relief, knowing that he's not alone in this feeling and also not "crazy"
- Gabriel will start to understand that his life so far was dictated by the external environment, and that answers are to be found by going inward
- The reassuring tone of the book will help Gabriel to take a decision to embark on this exploration journey
- While pain will not disappear, suffering will greatly diminish and the peace that surpasses all understanding will begin to permeate his life
- A new definition of success will emerge - one that is aligned with Gabriel's purpose, gifts and talents

## Book Idea

### In 200 words or less, describe your book

This book is for you, if most of your material and emotional needs are fulfilled and you still feel "something is missing". If you tried to understand why you feel this way and what to do about it and nothing so far worked.

It is time to turn inside to find the answers. "Finding God" is a companion to the journey inward.

This book is for professionals who consider themselves successful. Women and men over 35, with some life experience, and who have fulfilled many of their material desires. By reading this book you will gain peace in the midst of this suffering. Many others felt and feel this way - you are not alone nor crazy. The book will present an overview of the inner journey. With this new understanding comes hope. You will realize that once you choose to take the first step and ask for help, you will receive all that they need, and that this book is a practical companion to the steps of the inward journey that is, after all, an integral part of life.

## What Makes This Example Useful

Notice how this positioning document:

1. **Gets specific about the audience** - Not "everyone" but "professionals 35+, successful, feeling unfulfilled"
2. **Uses a real avatar** - The author himself at an earlier life stage
3. **Names the pain concretely** - "The hole in his chest so painful he cannot breathe"
4. **Defines measurable success** - "1,000 thank you emails in 3 years"
5. **Creates a clear North Star** - One sentence that guides everything

Your positioning document should be this specific. Vague = hard to write. Specific = GPS for your book.
