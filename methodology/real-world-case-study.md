## Overview

This document captures the real-world experience of writing a non-fiction book using a structured 9-part methodology with consistent 30-minute daily sessions. It demonstrates that writing a book is achievable for non-professional writers who have jobs and other commitments.

**Key insight:** The Q-System's strength is tracking work over long periods. Combined with a structured methodology, you can scaffold yourself up to writing a book.

## Timeline by Phase

### Parts 1-3: Prepare, Position, Outline
**Duration:** ~4 months (January - May 2021)

| Date | Artifact |
|------|----------|
| 2021-01-24 | Initial Outline |
| 2021-02-24 | Positioning Document |
| 2021-03-15 | Detailed Outline + Table of Contents |

| 2021-05-10 | Writing & Editing Plan |
| 2021-05-14 | Fear Solving Template |

**Professional consultation:** After outline, Emily reviewed and advised on chapter arrangement. Most work was solid.

### Part 4: Write (Vomit Draft)
**Duration:** ~9 months (May 2021 - January 2022)

The vomit draft writing followed a strict protocol:

1. **No rereading** - Never go back and read what you wrote
2. **No editing** - Just keep writing, don't fix anything
3. **Use the outline** - Open your outline, find where you left off
4. **Write from the outline** - Look at the chapter's stories, observations, and purpose
5. **Vomit** - Write impulsively, automatically, don't think

| Chapter | Completed |
|---------|-----------|
| Chapter X (template) | May 30, 2021 |
| Chapter 1: It's a dead end | Sep 24, 2021 |
| Chapter 2: Why the journey inward | Sep 24, 2021 |
| Chapter 3: You need help | Jun 14, 2021 |
| Chapter 4: Ask and it shall be given | Jun 19, 2021 |
| Chapter 5: Who not how | Jul 3, 2021 |
| Chapter 6: How to choose the Who | Sep 24, 2021 |
| Chapter 6.5: You are not your ego | Aug 16, 2021 |
| Chapter 7: Responsible Surrender | Sep 1, 2021 |
| Chapter 8: When to move on | Sep 18, 2021 |
| Chapter 9: The ultimate teacher | Sep 24, 2021 |
| Chapter 10: The Inner guide FAQ | Jan 4, 2022 |
| Chapter 11: When you desire to connect to God | Jan 15, 2022 |

**Why this works:** You don't have to think "what am I writing today?" The outline tells you exactly where you are and what to cover. You just write impulsively. Most people can train themselves to do this.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Permission to Go Slow
Setting a low minimum (200-250 words) gives you permission to show up even on hard days. Some days you write 500 words. But consistency beats intensity.

### 2. The Outline is Your GPS
During the writing phase, the outline removes all decision fatigue. You know exactly what chapter, what section, what stories. You just write.

### 3. Don't Edit While Writing
The "vomit draft" approach is counterintuitive but effective. Editing while writing kills momentum and flow. Write everything first, edit later.

### 4. Professional Help at Key Points
- Post-outline: Editor review saved rework later
- Structural edit: Professional eyes catch what you can't see
- Copy edit: Required for quality

### 5. Beta Readers Add Real Value
19 diverse readers caught issues and validated the book's impact before professional editing.

### 6. It's a Marathon
2.5 years from start to finish. The Q-System's session tracking makes this manageable by treating it as many small steps rather than one huge project.
