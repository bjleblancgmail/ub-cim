# Appendix A: Terminology Mapping Table

This appendix provides a reference for readers moving between A Course in Miracles and The Urantia Book. The two texts describe the same spiritual realities using different vocabularies — one filtered through Helen Schucman's Christian framework, the other using precise celestial terminology.

These mappings are not equations. Each term carries nuances the other may not. Use this table as a bridge, not a dictionary.

## Core Terminology

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Soul** | Thought Adjuster / Divine Monitor | The indestructible divine fragment indwelling the mind | Ch 5, 6 |
| **Altar** | Thought Adjuster | The sacred place within where you meet God | Ch 5 |
| **Sonship** | God the Supreme | The evolving totality of all souls/finite creation | Ch 5, 7 |
| **Holy Spirit** | Holy Spirit + Spirit of Truth | CIM often blends these; UB distinguishes them (see detailed note below) | Ch 5 |
| **Perception** | Adjutant mind / Temporal mind | The animal-origin intellect; subject to illusion | Ch 5, 13 |
| **Knowledge** | Eternal perspective / Superconscious | The Adjuster's viewpoint; direct knowing beyond time | Ch 5, 13 |
| **Ego** | Self-concept created by adjutant mind | Not inherently evil, but often distorted | Ch 5, 13 |
| **Will** | Personality | The unique Father-gift enabling choice | Ch 5 |
| **Atonement** | Plan of Ascension | The divine plan for mortal salvation | Ch 5 |

### Detailed: Soul = Thought Adjuster

**Course in Miracles:**
> "Your creations love you as your Soul loves your Father for the gift of creation."

**Urantia Book:**
> "Faith acts to release the superhuman activities of the divine spark, the immortal germ, that lives within the mind of man, and which is the potential of eternal survival."

The Course speaks of the "soul" as your true center — indestructible, perfect, divine. This corresponds directly to the Urantia Book's Thought Adjuster: the fragment of the Father that indwells every normal human mind. When the Course says to look within to your soul, it means turn attention to the Adjuster. (Ch 5, Section 3)

---

### Detailed: Sonship = God the Supreme

**Course in Miracles:**
> "Miracles make minds one in God. They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all the Souls God created."

**Urantia Book:**
> "The Supreme is the synthesis of creature personality and Creator nature."

The Course teaches the Sonship is the totality of God's creation — all souls together, functioning as one. The Urantia Book describes God the Supreme in remarkably similar terms — the evolving deity of time and space, growing through the experiences of all creatures. When the Course speaks of contributing to the Sonship, it means contributing to the growth of the Supreme. (Ch 5, Section 4; Ch 7)

---

### Detailed: Holy Spirit and Spirit of Truth

The Urantia Book clearly distinguishes:
- **Holy Spirit** — the ministry of the Divine Minister/Creative Spirit of the local universe
- **Spirit of Truth** — poured out by Jesus after his resurrection

The Course rarely makes this distinction explicit, but several passages reveal it:

**Two distinct ministries:**
> "The Holy One shares my trust and always approves my Atonement decisions because my will is never out of accord with His. I have told you before that I am in charge of the whole Atonement."

Here Jesus makes Atonement decisions; the Holy Spirit ("the Holy One") approves them. Two entities working in harmony.

**Jesus's "I" statements = Spirit of Truth:**
When Jesus says "I" in the Course — "I am in charge," "I will lend them my strength," "I lead," "I teach" — this is the Spirit of Truth in action. The Holy Spirit is referenced separately. (Ch 5, Section 2)

---

## The Fusion Process

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Miracle** | Fusion / Union of will | "The miracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between Father and son" | Ch 6, 9 |
| **Transfer** | Transfer of seat of identity | Movement from material to spiritual identification | Ch 6, 10 |
| **Bridge** | Living link / Jesus | "I am the living bridge from one world to another" | Ch 6, 10 |
| **The last step** | Fusion event | "The last step is taken by God" | Ch 10 |
| **Spark** | Thought Adjuster | "The divine spark, the immortal germ" | Ch 6 |
| **Your creations** | Morontia soul | What the Adjuster builds from your worthy thoughts | Ch 6, 8 |

### Detailed: The Miracle as Fusion

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The miracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between Father and son."

**Urantia Book:**
> "The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God."

The miracle is not *like* fusion. The miracle *is* fusion — the union of the human will with the divine will. Every time the Course speaks of miracles, it is speaking of this alignment. (Ch 6, Section 2)

---

### Detailed: Transfer of Identity

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge."

**Urantia Book:**
> "Selfhood of survival value, selfhood that can transcend the experience of death, is only evolved by establishing a potential transfer of the seat of the identity of the evolving personality from the transient life vehicle — the material body — to the more enduring and immortal nature of the morontia soul."

Same word: transfer. Same process: relocating your sense of self from the temporary to the permanent. (Ch 6, Section 4; Ch 10)

---

### Detailed: The Bridge

**Urantia Book (Jesus speaking):**
> "I am the living bridge from one world to another."
> "I am the living link between time and eternity."

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The bridge that He would carry you across lifts you from time into eternity."
> "The Holy Spirit remains the bridge between perception and knowledge."

Jesus is the bridge. He demonstrated in his own life the complete transfer. The Holy Spirit — which includes Jesus's Spirit of Truth — carries you across. (Ch 10, Section 3)

---

## Reality and Illusion

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Real / Reality** | Eternal / Spirit reality | What endures; what has survival value | Ch 8 |
| **Unreal / Illusion** | Temporal / Material | Not evil, but passing; "the shadow of spirit realities" | Ch 8 |
| **Nothing real can be threatened** | Nothing of survival value is ever lost | Same teaching, different words | Ch 8 |
| **Dream** | Material existence | The Course's metaphor for time-bound perception | Ch 8 |
| **Real World** | Morontia reality | The transitional state between material and spirit | Ch 8 |
| **Awakening** | Fusion / Spiritual birth | The moment of permanent union with the divine | Ch 8, 10 |
| **Shadow** | Material as reflection of spirit | "The unreal and fleeting shadow of spirit realities" | Ch 8 |
| **Scaffolding** | Temporal experience | Temporary but purposeful; "bridged you over to the morontia level" | Ch 8 |
| **Survival value** | What is real | What the Adjuster preserves | Ch 8 |

### Detailed: Nothing Real Can Be Threatened

**Course in Miracles:**
> "Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God."

**Urantia Book:**
> "Nothing of survival value is ever lost in all the wide universe."

Same teaching. What is real — what has survival value — cannot be destroyed. What is unreal — what has no survival value — passes away as scaffolding. (Ch 8, Section 2)

---

### Detailed: The Material as Shadow

**Urantia Book (Jesus speaking):**
> "He frequently alluded to the natural as 'the unreal and fleeting shadow of spirit realities.'"

**Urantia Book:**
> "Mankind is slow to perceive that, in all that is personal, matter is the skeleton of morontia, and that both are the reflected shadow of enduring spirit reality."

A shadow is real in its way — but it depends on a source. Jesus saw matter as a shadow cast by spirit. The material world is real enough to walk through, but it is not the source. (Ch 8, Section 3)

---

### Detailed: What Makes You Real

**Urantia Book:**
> "Only as a creature becomes God-identified, does he become truly real in the universes."

**Course in Miracles:**
> "You who identify with your egos cannot believe that God loves you."

You become real as you identify with what is eternal. What you identify with determines what you become. (Ch 8, Section 4)

---

## Mind and Spirit

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Right mind** | Superconscious / Adjuster-led mind | "The Holy Spirit is nothing more than your own right mind" | Ch 5, 10 |
| **Wrong mind** | Ego-dominated adjutant mind | The mind identified with fear and separation | Ch 13 |
| **Mind of Christ** | Spirit of Truth | Jesus's mind offered to us | Ch 10 |
| **One-mindedness** | Single-minded devotion | The state where transfer becomes possible | Ch 10 |
| **Split mind** | Conflict between ego and Adjuster | Living in two thought systems | Ch 11, 13 |
| **Seven adjutants** | Adjutant mind-spirits | The circuits of evolutionary mind | Ch 13 |
| **Circles** | Circles of attainment | Stages of spiritual progress | Ch 13 |
| **Mota** | Morontia insight | Bridges material logic and spiritual truth | Ch 8 |

### Detailed: Mind of Christ = Spirit of Truth

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is nothing more than your own right mind. He was also mine. The Bible says, 'May the mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus,' and uses this as a blessing."

**Urantia Book:**
> "If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well."

The bridge is not impersonal. It is the mind of Jesus — the same mind that achieved perfect alignment with the Father. He offers it to you. (Ch 10, Section 3)

---

### Detailed: Perception vs Knowledge

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The Holy Spirit is the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge."
> "When the Holy Spirit has at last led you to Christ... perception fuses into knowledge."

**Urantia Book:**
> "The human mind does not create real values; human experience does not yield universe insight. Concerning insight, the recognition of moral values and the discernment of spiritual meanings, all that the human mind can do is to discover, recognize, interpret, and choose."

Perception = how the material mind sees (partial, interpretive, filtered through fear). Knowledge = how spirit sees (direct, complete, unified with truth). The Holy Spirit bridges them. (Ch 13)

---

### Detailed: The Seven Adjutants and the Ego

**Urantia Book:**
> "From the seventh to the third circle there occurs increased and unified action of the seven adjutant mind-spirits in the task of weaning the mortal mind from its dependence on the realities of the material life mechanisms preparatory to increased introduction to morontia levels of experience. From the third circle onward the adjutant influence progressively diminishes."

The ego is not a separate entity. It is a pattern of thought that develops within the adjutant mind. As you progress spiritually, you rely less on the perceiving mind and more on the superconscious realm where the Adjuster works. (Ch 13, Section 4)

---

## Forgiveness and Healing

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Forgiveness (true)** | Forgiveness of love | "Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them" | Ch 12 |
| **Forgiveness (false)** | Forgiveness of mercy | Pardons but "retains the proof he is not really innocent" | Ch 12 |
| **Sin** | Error / Missing the mark | A call for love, not a reality to be punished | Ch 12 |
| **Guilt** | Fear-based self-condemnation | The ego's tool; dissolved by true forgiveness | Ch 12 |
| **Healing** | Soul growth / Spiritual progress | Restoration to right relationship with the Adjuster | Ch 12 |
| **Salvation** | Survival / Eternal life | The outcome of cooperating with the divine plan | Ch 12 |

### Detailed: Two Kinds of Forgiveness

**Course in Miracles:**
> "To witness sin and yet forgive it is a paradox which reason cannot see. For it maintains what has been done to you deserves no pardon. And by giving it, you grant your brother mercy but retain the proof he is not really innocent."

**Urantia Book:**
> "The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin and all weakness resulting therefrom."

The forgiveness of mercy keeps the wound alive. The forgiveness of love heals it completely. One says, "You are guilty but I pardon you." The other never saw guilt in the first place. (Ch 12)

---

## Time and Eternity

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Time** | Temporal existence | The arena of choice and growth | Ch 9 |
| **Eternity** | Paradise / Eternal career | The destination | Ch 9 |
| **Miracles shorten time** | Elimination of time | Both books use this exact concept | Ch 9 |
| **Laws of eternity** | Eternal law | Where cause and effect are simultaneous | Ch 9 |
| **Laws of time** | Material/natural law | Where cause precedes effect | Ch 9 |
| **Now / Present** | The holy instant | Where eternity touches time | Ch 9 |
| **Time consciousness** | Temporal awareness | What Jesus maintained to prevent instant manifestation | Ch 9 |

### Detailed: Miracles Shorten Time

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The miracle thus has the unique property of shortening time by rendering the space of time it occupies unnecessary."
> "Miracles therefore rest on the laws of eternity, not of time."

**Urantia Book:**
> "It therefore becomes evident that any possible supernatural or supposedly superhuman accompaniments of Jesus' ministry pertained wholly to the elimination of time unless the Father in heaven specifically ruled otherwise."

Both books state this explicitly. Miracles are not violations of natural law — they are operations that bypass the time factor. What would take years happens in moments. (Ch 9, Section 1-2)

---

### Detailed: Jesus and Time Consciousness

**Urantia Book:**
> "In order to prevent the appearance of apparent time miracles, it was necessary for Jesus to remain constantly time conscious. Any lapse of time consciousness on his part, in connection with the entertainment of definite desire, was equivalent to the enactment of the thing conceived in the mind of this Creator Son, and without the intervention of time."

If Jesus conceived a desire and momentarily forgot about time, the thing would simply happen immediately. His mind, connected to creative power, could manifest reality the moment time-awareness lapsed. This is why he performed relatively few miracles — he had to stay anchored in temporal flow. (Ch 9, Section 3)

---

## Fear and Love

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Fear** | Intellectual fraud / Rebellion legacy | "Unreasoned fear is a master intellectual fraud practiced upon the evolving mortal soul" | Ch 14 |
| **Love** | Divine love / The Father's nature | The foundation of reality | Ch 14 |
| **Attack** | Fear response / Ego defense | Never real; always a call for love misperceived | Ch 12, 14 |
| **Darkness and death** | Lucifer rebellion | CIM's oblique references to what UB explains in detail | Ch 15 |

---

## Relationships and Brothers

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Brothers** | Fellow ascenders / Children of God | All members of the Sonship / Supreme | Ch 7, 12 |
| **Holy relationship** | Spirit-led partnership | Relationship turned over to the Holy Spirit's purpose | — |
| **Special relationship** | Ego-based attachment | Relationship serving separation rather than union | — |
| **Holy instant** | Moment of Adjuster contact | A breakthrough moment of eternal perspective | Ch 9 |

---

## The Divine

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Father** | Universal Father / First Source | The infinite, eternal, perfect God | Ch 6 |
| **Son** | Eternal Son / Christ Michael | CIM usually means Jesus; UB distinguishes Eternal Son from Creator Sons | — |
| **Holy Spirit** | Infinite Spirit / Divine Minister | CIM uses loosely; UB provides hierarchy | Ch 5 |
| **Holy Trinity** | Paradise Trinity | Father, Son, and Spirit | Ch 6 |
| **Christ** | Christ Michael / Jesus | The Creator Son who incarnated on our world | — |
| **God** | Universal Father (primarily) | CIM uses broadly; UB specifies which Deity | — |

---

## Spiritual Vision

| Course in Miracles | Urantia Book | Notes | Chapter |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Spiritual eye** | Eye of faith | "The mechanism of miracles... looks past error to truth" | Ch 8 |
| **Vision** | Spiritual insight | Seeing through the eternal perspective | Ch 8 |
| **Seeing truly** | Mota / Morontia insight | Perception that has become transparent to knowledge | Ch 8, 13 |

### Detailed: The Spiritual Eye

**Course in Miracles:**
> "The spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles... It looks past error to truth, past what seems to be to what is."

**Urantia Book:**
> "By faith, the mortal soul gains entrance into the spiritual kingdom of heaven, and presently the light of the Father's love begins to illuminate the pathway of this truth-seeking soul."

The material eyes see only material things. To perceive spirit, you need spiritual sight. The spiritual eye does not deny the world — it interprets it differently. (Ch 8, Section 6)

## Cautions for Using This Table

**1. Avoid over-simplification.** These mappings identify correspondences, not equations. The Course and the Urantia Book have different emphases. Neither is subordinate to the other.

**2. Context matters.** The same Course term may have different meanings in different passages. "Soul" sometimes refers to the Adjuster, sometimes to the emerging morontia soul, sometimes to the whole person.

**3. The mapping is incomplete.** Further study may reveal additional nuances. This bridge is under construction.

**4. Watch for the Spirit of Truth pattern.** When Jesus says "I" in the Course — "I am in charge," "I will lend them my strength," "I lead," "I teach" — this is the Spirit of Truth in action. The Holy Spirit is referenced separately.

**5. Both texts are revelatory.** The Urantia Book provides the cosmological framework. The Course provides the practical method. One without the other is incomplete.

---

## Using This Appendix

When reading the Course, use this table to bring your Urantia Book understanding to bear. When reading the Urantia Book, recall what the Course teaches about the same realities.

The bridge goes both directions. Use it to:
- Resolve apparent contradictions
- Deepen understanding of either text
- Recognize the same truths in different language
- Find chapter references for deeper study

Two vocabularies. One truth. The bridge helps you see it.
