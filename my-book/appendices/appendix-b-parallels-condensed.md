# Appendix B: Selected Parallels: Urantia Book and Course in Miracles

*57 parallels between The Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles, organized by correlation strength. Drawn from 30+ years of comparative study.*

---

## TIER 1: NEAR-IDENTICAL LANGUAGE

These parallels use strikingly similar or nearly identical wording.

---

### 1. Deny the Body / Deny the Mechanism

**JCIM:**
> "The body is merely a fact in human experience. Its abilities can be and frequently are over-evaluated. HOWEVER, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY ITS EXISTENCE. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial."

**Urantia Book (118:9.4):**
> "The grand universe is mechanism as well as organism, mechanical and living—a living mechanism activated by a Supreme Mind. BUT TO DENY THE MECHANISM OF THE FINITE CREATION IS TO DENY FACT AND TO DISREGARD REALITY."

*Parallel warning against denying physical/material reality. Both texts reject the notion that spirituality requires denying the body or material world.*

---

### 2. Elder Brother and Sonship

**JCIM:**
> "I bridge the distance as an ELDER BROTHER to man on the one hand and as a Son of God on the other. My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the SONSHIP."

> "An ELDER BROTHER is entitled to respect for his greater experience and a reasonable amount of obedience for his greater wisdom."

**Urantia Book (40:6.5):**
> "A Creator Son of God became one of you; he is your ELDER BROTHER in fact."

> "You have accepted the status of SONSHIP. You believe in the reality of your SONSHIP, and thus does your SONSHIP with God become eternally real."

*Identical terminology: "Elder Brother" and "Sonship" used in the same relational context.*

---

### 3. The Divine Spark / Adjuster

**JCIM:**
> "The power of one mind can shine into another because all the lamps of God were lit by the same SPARK. It is everywhere, and it is eternal."

> "In many only the SPARK remains, for the Great Rays are obscured. Yet God has kept the SPARK alive so that the rays can never be completely forgotten."

> "If you but see the little SPARK, you will learn of the greater light, for the rays are there unseen. Perceiving the SPARK will heal, but knowing the light will create."

**Urantia Book (132:3.6):**
> "Faith acts to release the superhuman activities of the divine SPARK, the immortal germ, that lives within the mind of man, and which is the potential of eternal survival. The human soul of man survives mortal death by identity association with this indwelling SPARK of divinity, which is immortal."

*Same metaphor: The divine spark dwelling within the human mind, kept alive by God, enabling eternal survival.*

---

### 4. Forgiveness Already Accomplished

**JCIM:**
> "ASK NOT TO BE FORGIVEN, FOR THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. Ask, rather, to learn how to forgive and restore what always was to your unforgiving mind."

**Urantia Book (146:2.4):**
> "THE FATHER IN HEAVEN HAS FORGIVEN YOU EVEN BEFORE YOU HAVE THOUGHT TO ASK HIM, but such forgiveness is not available in your personal religious experience until such a time as you forgive your fellow men."

*Identical teaching: Divine forgiveness precedes the asking. Our task is to learn to forgive others.*

---

### 5. Words Are Valueless — Spirit Content Matters

**JCIM:**
> "Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking... Words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality."

**Urantia Book (7:3.7):**
> "It is the motivating thought, the spiritual content, that validates the mortal supplication. Words are valueless."

*Nearly identical: Both dismiss words as spiritual vehicles; what matters is the spiritual content and motivation behind them.*

---

### 6. Free Will Cannot Be Overridden

**JCIM:**
> "MY WILL CANNOT OVERCOME YOURS, BECAUSE YOURS IS AS POWERFUL AS MINE. If it were not so, the Sons of God would be unequal... YOUR WILL IS AS FREE AS MINE, AND GOD HIMSELF WOULD NOT GO AGAINST IT."

**Urantia Book (1:1.2):**
> "THE CREATOR REFUSES TO COERCE OR COMPEL THE SUBMISSION OF THE SPIRITUAL FREE WILLS OF HIS MATERIAL CREATURES."

**Urantia Book (5:6.8):**
> "NO OTHER BEING, FORCE, CREATOR, OR AGENCY in all the wide universe of universes CAN INTERFERE TO ANY DEGREE WITH THE ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE MORTAL FREE WILL."

*Same doctrine: Divine respect for creature free will is absolute. Not even God overrides it.*

---

### 7. Reliable but Wrong / Right in Fact, Wrong in Truth

**JCIM:**
> "You can be wholly reliable and entirely wrong."

**Urantia Book (48:6.33):**
> "One can be technically right as to fact and everlastingly wrong in the truth."

*Nearly identical aphorism about the difference between technical correctness and spiritual truth.*

---

### 8. Truth Is Changeless

**JCIM (Tx:5.46):**
> "Truth is beyond your ability to destroy but entirely within your grasp. It belongs to you because you created it. It is yours because it is a part of you, just as you are part of God because He created you."

**Urantia Book (2:2.2):**
> "Whatsoever God does, it shall be forever; nothing can be added to it nor anything taken from it."

*Same teaching: Eternal truth is unchangeable.*

---

### 9. Conflict Is Evil / Civil War in Personality

**JCIM:**
> "Conflict and peace are opposites. Where one abides the other cannot be; where either goes the other disappears."

**Urantia Book (111:4.11):**
> "All conflict is evil in that it inhibits the creative function of the inner life—it is a species of civil war in the personality."

*Same insight: Internal conflict is destructive to spiritual growth.*

---

### 10. Constant Communication with God

**JCIM:**
> "The Communication Link which God Himself placed within you, joining your minds with His, cannot be broken... the sweet and CONSTANT COMMUNICATION which God would share with you."

**Urantia Book (110:1.1):**
> "And indirectly and unrecognized the Adjuster is CONSTANTLY COMMUNICATING with the human subject, especially during those sublime experiences of the worshipful contact of mind with spirit in the superconsciousness."

*Same reality: An unbroken divine communication channel exists within us.*

---

### 11. Loneliness of God / Adjuster

**JCIM:**
> "His joy is not complete because yours is incomplete... HE IS LONELY when the minds He created do not communicate fully with Him."

**Urantia Book (107:6.2):**
> "They truly and divinely love you; they are the prisoners of spirit hope confined within the minds of men. THEY LONG FOR THE DIVINITY ATTAINMENT OF YOUR MORTAL MINDS THAT THEIR LONELINESS MAY END."

*Striking parallel: God/Adjuster experiences a kind of loneliness waiting for us to respond.*

---

## TIER 2: SAME CONCEPT, DIFFERENT WORDS

These parallels express identical concepts using different terminology.

---

### 12. Two Thought Systems / Fringe of Conflict

**JCIM:**
> "The way out of conflict between two opposing thought systems is clearly to choose one and relinquish the other. If you identify with your thought system... and if you accept two thought systems which are in complete disagreement, peace of mind is impossible."

**Urantia Book (159:3.7):**
> "Forewarn all believers regarding the fringe of conflict which must be traversed by all who pass from the life as it is lived in the flesh to the higher life as it is lived in the spirit. To those who live quite wholly within either realm, there is little conflict."

*Same insight: Living between two realities (material and spiritual) creates unavoidable conflict.*

---

### 13. Angels Withdrawn After Adamic Default

**JCIM:**
> "Many Souls offered their efforts on behalf of the separated ones, but they could not withstand the strength of the attack and had to be brought back. Angels came, too, but their protection did not suffice."

**Urantia Book (39:5.2):**
> "On Urantia the majority of the planetary helpers were removed upon the collapse of the Adamic regime, and the seraphic supervision of your world devolved to a greater extent upon the administrators."

*Both describe celestial helpers being withdrawn from our world after a catastrophic event.*

---

### 14. Lack of Love as the Problem

**JCIM:**
> "AS SOON AS YOU REGARD SIN AS A LACK YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY ATTEMPT TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. And you will succeed."

**Urantia Book (156:5.11):**
> "THE LESS OF LOVE IN ANY CREATURE'S NATURE, THE GREATER THE LOVE NEED, and the more does divine love seek to satisfy such need."

*Same reframe: Sin/evil is a lack (of love) rather than a positive force.*

---

### 15. Soul Cannot Perceive / Beyond Intellectual Comprehension

**JCIM:**
> "The Soul cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication."

**Urantia Book (5:5.6):**
> "The realities of religion are utterly beyond the mortal capacity for intellectual comprehension."

*Same limitation: Spiritual realities cannot be grasped by the material/ego mind.*

---

### 16. Mind Wandering / Deaf to Spiritual Pleas

**JCIM:**
> "You are much too tolerant of mind wandering, thus passively condoning its miscreations."

**Urantia Book (110:7.6):**
> "So few mortals are real thinkers; you do not spiritually develop and discipline your minds to the point of favorable liaison with the divine Adjusters. The ear of the human mind is almost deaf to the spiritual pleas which the Adjuster translates."

*Same concern: Undisciplined minds miss divine communication.*

---

### 17. Listen, Learn, and Do / Action Required

**JCIM:**
> "The slogan for the Crusade is 'Listen, learn and do'... THE FIRST TWO ARE NOT ENOUGH. THE REAL MEMBERS OF MY PARTY ARE ACTIVE WORKERS."

**Urantia Book (115:0.1):**
> "WITH GOD THE FATHER, sonship is the great relationship. With God the Supreme, achievement is the prerequisite to status—ONE MUST DO SOMETHING AS WELL AS BE SOMETHING."

**Urantia Book (117:4.7):**
> "Mankind does not ascend effortlessly in the universe, neither does the Supreme evolve without purposeful and intelligent action."

*Same teaching: Passive belief is insufficient; action is required for spiritual progress.*

---

### 18. The Circle of Creation

**JCIM:**
> "THE CIRCLE OF CREATION HAS NO END. Its starting and its ending are the same. But in itself it holds the universe of all creation, without beginning and without an end."

**Urantia Book (105:0.1):**
> "The human mind may helpfully approach the problem by conceiving eternity-infinity AS AN ALMOST LIMITLESS ELLIPSE which is produced by one absolute cause, and which functions throughout this universal circle of endless diversification."

*Same geometry: Creation as an endless circle/ellipse with no beginning or end.*

---

### 19. Returning Home / Finding the Supreme

**JCIM:**
> "Listen and see if you remember an ancient song you knew so long ago and held more dear than any melody you taught yourself to cherish since."

**Urantia Book (117:6.1):**
> "The Supreme is your universe home, and when you find him, it will be like returning home."

*Same experience: Spiritual attainment feels like homecoming, like remembering something ancient.*

---

### 20. Past-Eternity Memory

**JCIM:**
> "To remember is merely to restore to your mind what is already there. You do not make what you remember; you merely accept again what has been made but was rejected."

**Urantia Book (112:7.1):**
> "Thought Adjuster fusion imparts eternal actualities to personality which were previously only potential. Among these new endowments may be mentioned: fixation of divinity quality, PAST-ETERNITY EXPERIENCE AND MEMORY, immortality."

*Same concept: We carry or will receive memories from before this temporal life.*

---

### 21. Projection as Fundamental Law

**JCIM:**
> "PROJECTION IS A FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE MIND and therefore one which always operates. It is the law by which you create and were created."

**Urantia Book (54:2.1):**
> "With the Son and in the Spirit did God PROJECT eternal Havona, and ever since has there obtained the eternal pattern of co-ordinate participation in creation—SHARING."

**Urantia Book (11:9.3):**
> "Thus did the Father PROJECT reality in two actual phases."

*Same mechanism: Projection/sharing as the fundamental law of creation.*

---

### 22. World of Unreality from the Rebellion

**JCIM:**
> "IT WAS SO VAST AND SO COMPLETELY INCREDIBLE THAT FROM IT A WORLD OF TOTAL UNREALITY HAD TO EMERGE."

**Urantia Book (67:0.1):**
> "The problems associated with human existence on Urantia are impossible of understanding without a knowledge of certain great epochs of the past, notably the occurrence and consequences of the planetary rebellion... IT DID MARKEDLY MODIFY THE COURSE OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION AND OF SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT."

*Same origin: A catastrophic error (the rebellion) created our distorted, confused reality.*

---

### 23. Mind of Jesus / Holy Spirit

**JCIM:**
> "The Holy Spirit is nothing more than your own right mind. HE WAS ALSO MINE. The Bible says, 'May the mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus.'"

**Urantia Book (48:6.26):**
> "Even on Urantia, these seraphim teach the everlasting truth: If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the MIND OF JESUS of Nazareth, who always serves you well."

*Same resource: Jesus's mind is available to us as a replacement for our confused thinking.*

---

### 24. Illusion of Loneliness / Personality Isolation

**JCIM:**
> "I am come as a light into a world that does deny itself everything... It is therefore an illusion of isolation, maintained by fear of the same loneliness which is its illusion. IF I AM WITH YOU IN THE LONELINESS OF THE WORLD, THE LONELINESS IS GONE."

**Urantia Book (184:4.6):**
> "Jesus is now revealing to the worlds the final triumph over all fears of creature personality isolation... the SPIRITUALLY ISOLATED AND COSMICALLY LONELY MORTALS OF EARTH ARE ENABLED TO ESCAPE PERSONALITY ISOLATION, with all its consequences of fear."

*Same victory: Jesus overcomes the illusion of isolation; his presence ends our loneliness.*

---

### 25. No Private Thoughts

**JCIM:**
> "Today we are again emphasizing the fact that minds are joined... it is a fact that there are no private thoughts."

**Urantia Book (28:6.19):**
> "The real nature of any service, be it rendered by man or angel, is fully revealed in the faces of these secoraphic service indicators... Mortals may employ words to conceal their thoughts, but these high seconaphim lay bare the deep motives of the human heart."

*Same revelation: Thoughts are not truly private; the universe sees our true motives.*

---

### 26. Your Creations / Adjuster Duplicates

**JCIM:**
> "Your creations are protected for you because the Holy Spirit, Who is in your mind, knows of them and can bring them into your awareness whenever you will let Him."

**Urantia Book (108:6.5):**
> "These faithful custodians of the future career unfailingly duplicate every mental creation with a spiritual counterpart; they are thus slowly and surely re-creating you as you really are."

**Urantia Book (110:2.4):**
> "Adjusters work in the spheres of the higher levels of the human mind, unceasingly seeking to produce morontia duplicates of EVERY CONCEPT of the mortal intellect."

*Same process: The divine indweller preserves and duplicates our worthy mental creations.*

---

### 27. Simultaneous Discovery of the Supreme/Sonship

**JCIM:**
> "When the Atonement has been completed, all talents will be shared by all the Sons of God."

**Urantia Book (117:6.21):**
> "No single ascender will ever find the Supreme until all ascenders have reached that maximum universe maturity which qualifies them simultaneously to participate in this discovery."

*Same culmination: We will all reach the goal together, not individually.*

---

### 28. Forgiveness Destroys Sin vs. Pardon Preserves It

**JCIM:**
> "To witness sin and yet forgive it is a paradox which reason cannot see. For it maintains what has been done to you deserves no pardon. And by giving it, you grant your brother mercy but retain the proof he is not really innocent."

**Urantia Book (188:5.2):**
> "Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them. The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin."

*Same distinction: True forgiveness (of love) destroys sin; mere pardon (of mercy) preserves it.*

---

### 29. Limits on Free Will / Creation Limits

**JCIM:**
> "Everything is limited in some way by the manner of its creation. FREE WILL CAN TEMPORIZE AND IS CAPABLE OF ENORMOUS PROCRASTINATION. BUT IT CANNOT DEPART ENTIRELY FROM ITS CREATOR, WHO SET THE LIMITS ON ITS ABILITY TO MISCREATE."

**Urantia Book (118:9.2):**
> "MECHANISMS PRODUCED BY HIGHER MINDS FUNCTION TO LIBERATE THEIR CREATIVE SOURCES BUT TO SOME DEGREE UNVARYINGLY LIMIT THE ACTION OF ALL SUBORDINATE INTELLIGENCES."

*Same principle: While free will is sovereign, it operates within limits set by the Creator.*

---

### 30. "What Is the You?" / The Real You

**JCIM:**
> "WHAT IS THE 'YOU' WHO ARE LIVING IN THIS WORLD? IMMORTALITY IS A CONSTANT STATE. It is as true now as it ever was or ever will be because it implies no change at all."

**Urantia Book (108:6.6):**
> "And as you are the human parent, so is the Adjuster the divine parent of THE REAL YOU, your higher and advancing self, your better morontial and future spiritual self."

*Same question: Both texts point to an eternal, unchanging identity beyond the temporal self.*

---

### 31. Soul = Adjuster Substitution

**JCIM (with "Adjuster" substituted for "Soul"):**
> "God and the souls (Adjusters) He created are completely dependent on each other."
> "The soul (Adjuster) never loses its communion with God."
> "Souls (Adjusters) are perfect creations and experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection."
> "The soul (Adjuster) yearns to share its being as its Creator did."
> "Each soul (Adjuster) knows God completely."

**Urantia Book (40:5.4):**
> "Spirit identification constitutes the secret of personal survival and determines the destiny of spiritual ascension. And since the Thought Adjusters are the only spirits of fusion potential to be identified with man during the life in the flesh."

*Terminology bridge: When the Course says "soul," substituting "Adjuster" often clarifies the meaning.*

---

### 32. Spiritual Experiences Are for Believers

**JCIM:**
> "The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is wrong, or better, is a misunderstanding of their purpose. They are really used for and by believers."

**Urantia Book (1:6.6):**
> "The God-knowing man describes his spiritual experiences, not to convince unbelievers, but for the edification and mutual satisfaction of believers."

*Same audience: Spiritual experiences are for those who already believe, not for convincing skeptics.*

---

### 33. Worship as Identification with the Whole

**JCIM:**
> "The little that the body fences off becomes the self, preserved through sacrifice of all the rest... If we see ourselves as one self, we will find our Self."

**Urantia Book (143:7.8):**
> "Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole."

**Urantia Book (143:7.7):**
> "Worship is self-forgetting—superthinking."

*Same dynamic: We find our true Self by identifying with the Whole rather than defending the little self.*

---

### 34. Assault Can Only Be Made on the Body

**JCIM:**
> "ASSAULT CAN ULTIMATELY BE MADE ONLY ON THE BODY. There is little doubt that one body can assault another and can even destroy it. YET IF DESTRUCTION ITSELF IS IMPOSSIBLE, THEN ANYTHING THAT IS DESTRUCTIBLE CANNOT BE REAL."

**Urantia Book (165:3.3):**
> "But I say to you, my friends, when they seek to destroy the Son of Man, be not afraid of them. Fear not those who, ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE ABLE TO KILL THE BODY, AFTER THAT HAVE NO MORE POWER OVER YOU."

**Urantia Book (150:4.2):**
> "BE NOT AFRAID OF THOSE WHO CAN KILL THE BODY, BUT WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO DESTROY THE SOUL."

*Same teaching: The body can be harmed but the real self cannot be destroyed. Jesus demonstrated this in the crucifixion.*

---

### 35. Holy Spirit/Vision Replaces Judgment

**JCIM:**
> "Judgment will always give you false directions, but vision shows you where to go. Why should you guess?"

> "There is another vision and another Voice in which your freedom lies awaiting but your choice."

**Urantia Book (48:6.26):**
> "If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well."

*Same solution: Replace your faulty judgment with divine vision/the mind of Jesus.*

---

### 36. Timelessness and Miracles

**JCIM:**
> "What is the face of Christ but his who went a moment into timelessness and brought a clear reflection of the unity he felt an instant back to bless the world?"

**Urantia Book (136:5.5):**
> "In order to prevent the appearance of apparent time miracles, it was necessary for Jesus to remain constantly time conscious. Any lapse of time consciousness on his part... was equivalent to the enactment of the thing conceived in the mind of this Creator Son, and without the intervention of time."

*Same connection: Stepping into timelessness enables miracles and spiritual insight.*

---

### 37. Language Limits When Describing Eternity

**JCIM:**
> "God does not take steps because His accomplishments are not gradual. HE DOES NOTHING LAST BECAUSE HE CREATED FIRST AND FOR ALWAYS. IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD 'FIRST' AS APPLIED TO HIM IS NOT A TIME CONCEPT."

**Urantia Book (6:0.2):**
> "WE SPEAK OF GOD'S 'FIRST' THOUGHT AND ALLUDE TO AN IMPOSSIBLE TIME ORIGIN of the Eternal Son for the purpose of gaining access to the thought channels of the human intellect. Such distortions of language represent our best efforts at CONTACT-COMPROMISE WITH THE TIME-BOUND MINDS OF MORTAL CREATURES."

*Same acknowledgment: Language fails when describing eternal realities; "first" is not a time concept.*

---

### 38. Time-Space Belief and the Atonement

**JCIM:**
> "The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement itself began... ACTS WERE NOT NECESSARY BEFORE THE SEPARATION BECAUSE THE TIME-SPACE BELIEF DID NOT EXIST."

> "The Atonement was BUILT INTO THE SPACE-TIME BELIEF IN ORDER TO SET A LIMIT ON THE NEED FOR THE BELIEF."

**Urantia Book (118:8.5):**
> "The same creative design which purposed evolution likewise provide those external RESTRAINTS OF TIME AND SPACE, HUNGER AND FEAR, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CIRCUMSCRIBE THE SUBSPIRITUAL CHOICE RANGE of such uncultured creatures."

*Same framework: Time-space was created with built-in limits and provisions for salvation.*

---

### 39. The Separation Theme

**JCIM:**
> "Until the 'separation,' which is a better term than the 'fall,' nothing was lacking. This meant that man had no needs at all."

**Urantia Book (5:1.10):**
> "The Father is not in spiritual hiding, but so many of his creatures have hidden themselves away in the mists of their own willful decisions AND FOR THE TIME BEING HAVE SEPARATED THEMSELVES from the communion of his spirit."

*Same theme: A separation occurred that created the sense of lack and need.*

---

### 40. Did the Universe Come from Mind?

**JCIM:**
> "The Holy Spirit must perceive time and reinterpret it into the timeless. The mind must be led into eternity through time because, having made time, it is capable of perceiving its opposite."

**Urantia Book (42:11.2):**
> "Mechanisms do not absolutely dominate the total creation; the universe of universes in toto is mind planned, mind made, and mind administered."

*Same origin: Mind created/made time and the universe.*

---

### 41. Joint Will of the Sonship / God the Supreme

**JCIM:**
> "The full power of creation cannot be expressed as long as any of God's ideas withhold it from the Kingdom. The joint will of all the Sonship is the only creator that can create like the Father because only the complete can think completely."

> "We are the joint will of the Sonship, whose wholeness is for all."

*God the Supreme reference: The Sonship functions as a collective, unified will—paralleling the UB's teaching on the Supreme.*

---

### 42. Do Thoughts Occupy Space?

**JCIM:**
> "Ideas do not leave the mind which thought them to have a separate being, NOR DO SEPARATE THOUGHTS CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER IN SPACE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT OCCUPY SPACE AT ALL."

**Urantia Book (118:3.7):**
> "DOES THE PATTERN—THE REALITY—OF AN IDEA OCCUPY SPACE? We really do not know, albeit we are sure that an idea pattern does not contain space."

*Same philosophical question: Both texts ponder whether thoughts/ideas have spatial existence.*

---

### 43. Adjusting Self to Other Selves

**JCIM:**
> "Each man makes one ego for himself, although it is subject to enormous variation because of its instability, and one for everyone he perceives, which is equally variable. Their interaction is a process which literally alters both."

**Urantia Book (99:5.1):**
> "While religion is exclusively a personal spiritual experience—knowing God as a Father—the corollary of this experience—knowing man as a brother—entails the adjustment of the self to other selves."

*Same dynamic: Spiritual life involves constant adjustment between self and other selves.*

---

### 44. Turn the Other Cheek — Active Response

**JCIM:**
> "My one lesson, which I must teach as I learned, is that no perception which is out of accord with the judgment of the Holy Spirit can be justified."

**Urantia Book (159:5.9):**
> "He even opposed negative or purely passive nonresistance. Said he: 'When an enemy smites you on one cheek, do not stand there dumb and passive but in positive attitude turn the other; that is, do the best thing possible actively to lead your brother in error away from the evil paths.'"

*Same teaching: Jesus's response to attack is active, not passive—choosing the Holy Spirit's interpretation over the ego's.*

---

### 45. Appeal to the Spirit Within

**JCIM:**
> "You do not put the Spirit in them by inspiring them because that would be magic and therefore would not be real healing. You do, however, recognize the Spirit that is already there and thereby reawaken it."

**Urantia Book (159:3.2):**
> "Make your appeals directly to the divine spirit that dwells within the minds of men. Do not appeal to fear, pity, or mere sentiment. In appealing to men, be fair; exercise self-control and exhibit due restraint; show proper respect for the personalities of your pupils."

*Same method: True healing/teaching appeals to the spirit already present within, not external manipulation.*

---

### 46. Elect to Stay Behind After Fusion

**JCIM:**
> "THE ONLY VALUE WHICH THE BODY HAS IS TO ENABLE YOU TO BRING YOUR BROTHERS TO THE BRIDGE WITH YOU AND TO BE RELEASED TOGETHER THERE."

**Urantia Book (55:3.18):**
> "Mortals of Adjuster-fusion status who, UPON THEIR OWN PETITION, ARE TEMPORARILY EXEMPTED FROM TRANSLATION by the order of the Personalized Adjuster of universe chieftainship in order that they may continue on the planet in certain important administrative posts."

*Same possibility: After spiritual attainment, one may choose to remain to help others.*

---

### 47. Spirit Energy Can Be Manipulated

**JCIM:**
> "YET IF YOU SEE ITS EFFECTS, YOU KNOW IT MUST BE THERE. By perceiving what it does, you recognize its being."

> "The Holy Spirit is invisible, but you can see the results of His Presence, and through them you will learn that He is there."

**Urantia Book (44:5.4):**
> "Spiritual energy acts in accordance with established laws, just as does physical energy. There are just as certain and reliable laws in the spirit world as obtain in the material realms."

*Same principle: Spirit operates by laws and can be known by its effects.*

---

### 48. The Spiritual Eye

**JCIM:**
> "Corrective learning always begins with the awakening of the Spiritual eye and the turning away from the belief in physical sight... the Spiritual eye cannot see error and is capable only of looking beyond it to the defense of Atonement."

**Urantia Book (142:6.7):**
> "And so finding yourself born of the spirit and happily in the kingdom of God, you would begin to bear in your daily life the abundant fruits of the spirit... very soon would you begin to see with the EYES OF THE SPIRIT."

*Same vision: Spiritual sight sees beyond physical appearances to spiritual reality.*

---

### 49. Levels of Thought: Meaning and Values

**JCIM:**
> "Understanding is beyond perception because it introduces meaning. It is, however, below knowledge even though it can grow towards it."

**Urantia Book (118:5.3):**
> "Mortal consciousness proceeds from the fact, to the meaning, and then to the value. Creator consciousness proceeds from the thought-value, through the word-meaning, to the fact of action."

*Same hierarchy: Consciousness moves through levels—from facts to meanings to values.*

---

### 50. God Gives Everything

**JCIM:**
> "God, Who encompasses all being, nevertheless created beings who have everything individually but who want to share it to increase their joy... REAL CREATION GIVES EVERYTHING, since it can create only like itself."

**Urantia Book (10:1.2):**
> "THE UNIVERSAL FATHER ALL ALONG HAS DIVESTED HIMSELF OF EVERY PART OF HIMSELF THAT WAS BESTOWABLE ON ANY OTHER CREATOR OR CREATURE... HE HAS GIVEN AWAY, actually bestowed, with the dignity and sanctity of personality possession, ALL OF HIMSELF AND ALL OF HIS ATTRIBUTES, EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY COULD DIVEST HIMSELF OF."

*Same generosity: God gives everything possible; real creation gives everything.*

---

### 51. Jesus Earned His Sovereignty

**JCIM:**
> "IT WAS ONLY MY DECISION THAT GAVE ME ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH. My only gift to you is to help you make the same decision for yourself."

**Urantia Book (134:8.9):**
> "On an afternoon in late summer, amid the trees and in the silence of nature, MICHAEL OF NEBADON WON THE UNQUESTIONED SOVEREIGNTY OF HIS UNIVERSE."

**Urantia Book (136:3.5):**
> "THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MICHAEL NUMBER 611,121 OVER HIS UNIVERSE OF NEBADON RESTS IN COMPLETION."

*Same achievement: Jesus earned his sovereignty through his decisions and life choices.*

---

### 52. Circle Attainment / Adjutant Influence Diminishes

**JCIM (M:9.2):**
> "As the teacher of God advances in his training, he learns one lesson with increasing thoroughness. He does not make his own decisions; he asks his Teacher for His answer, and it is this he follows as his guide for action."

**Urantia Book (110:6.20):**
> "From the seventh to the third circle there occurs increased and unified action of the seven adjutant mind-spirits in the task of weaning the mortal mind from its dependence on the realities of the material life mechanisms... From the third circle onward the ADJUTANT INFLUENCE PROGRESSIVELY DIMINISHES."

*Same progression: As we advance spiritually, reliance on material/adjutant mind decreases.*

---

## TIER 3: SUPPORTING CORRELATIONS

These parallels show conceptual alignment without exact matching.

---

### 53. Peace and Understanding Go Together

**JCIM:**
> "Think not you understand anything until you pass the test of perfect peace, for peace and understanding go together and never can be found alone."

**Urantia Book (157:2.2):**
> "And there can be no peace in the heart or progress in the mind unless you fall wholeheartedly in love with truth."

*Related insight: Peace and understanding/truth are inseparable.*

---

### 54. What Is Real? Changelessness

**JCIM:**
> "It cannot change with time or mood or chance. Its changelessness is what makes it real."

**Urantia Book (102:3.15):**
> "The eternal real is the good of the universe and not the time illusions of space evil."

*Same criterion: Reality is defined by changelessness/eternality.*

### 55. Practice and Commotion

**JCIM:**
> "The speed by which it can be reached depends on this one thing alone—your willingness to practice every step."

**Urantia Book (100:4.2):**
> "Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion."

*Same reality: Spiritual progress requires practice and involves unavoidable struggle.*

---

### 56. Universes Virtually Nonexistent to the Father

**JCIM:**
> "The world as you perceive it cannot have been created by the Father, for the world is not as you see it. God created only the eternal."

**Urantia Book (15:0.1):**
> "AS FAR AS the Universal Father is concerned—as a Father—the universes are virtually nonexistent; he deals with personalities; he is the Father of personalities."

*Same perspective: From the Father's eternal viewpoint, the material world is not the focus.*

---

### 57. Give and Receive Are One

**JCIM:**
> "A major learning goal this course has set is to reverse your view of giving, so you can receive. For giving has become a source of fear... God's gifts will never lessen when they are given away. They but increase thereby."

**Urantia Book (100:7.10):**
> "The Master was always generous. He never grew weary of saying, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Said he, 'Freely you have received, freely give.'"

*Same principle: True giving increases rather than diminishes.*
