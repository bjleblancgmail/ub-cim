# Appendix C: CIM Miracle Principles with UB Parallels

The first chapter of the Course in Miracles lays out fifty principles of miracles. These principles contain stunning parallels to concepts found in The Urantia Book. Below are the first twenty-five principles, each paired with relevant UB passages and commentary showing how these two revelations illuminate the same truths from different angles.

Principles 26-50 will be added in a future edition.

---

## Principle 1

> "There is no order of difficulty among miracles. One is not 'harder' or 'bigger' than another. They are all the same. All expressions of love are maximal." (Tx:1.1)

In several places the UB says that when we line up our will with God's will, all things are possible.

> "With our heavenly Father all things are possible. Since he is the Creator, having made all things and all beings, it could not be otherwise." (UB 131:10.2)

> "When you have become wholly dedicated to the doing of the will of the Father in heaven, the answer to all your petitions will be forthcoming because your prayers will be in full accordance with the Father's will, and the Father's will is ever manifest throughout his vast universe. What the true son desires and the infinite Father wills IS. Such a prayer cannot remain unanswered, and no other sort of petition can possibly be fully answered." (UB 146:2.7)

---

## Principle 2

> "Miracles as such do not matter. The only thing that matters is their Source, Which is far beyond human evaluation." (Tx:1.2)

The source of miracles is the Adjuster. In Paper 136, Jesus made many decisions on how he would perform his public ministry. One decision was that he would not utilize the celestial hosts to perform superhuman feats. His Adjuster assured him they would honor his wish except when it involved the Father's will. The fact that he was discussing how he would limit the use of miracles with his Adjuster means the Adjuster is the source of miracles. And the Adjuster is beyond human evaluation.

> "In accepting this command of the universe hosts in attendance upon Christ Michael, the Personalized Adjuster took great pains to point out to Jesus that, while such an assembly of universe creatures could be limited in their space activities by the delegated authority of their Creator, such limitations were not operative in connection with their function in time." (UB 136:5.4)

> "In order to prevent the appearance of apparent time miracles, it was necessary for Jesus to remain constantly time conscious. Any lapse of time consciousness on his part, in connection with the entertainment of definite desire, was equivalent to the enactment of the thing conceived in the mind of this Creator Son, and without the intervention of time." (UB 136:5.5)

---

## Principle 3

> "Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. The real miracle is the love that inspires them. In this sense, everything that comes from love is a miracle." (Tx:1.3)

One of the stories of healing in the UB is a great example of how miracles can occur naturally. In this case Jesus was totally unaware.

> "And when those who were near him denied that they had touched him, Peter spoke up: 'Master, you can see that this crowd presses you, threatening to crush us, and yet you say someone has touched me.' ... As Jesus looked about him, his eyes fell upon a near-by woman, who, coming forward, knelt at his feet and said: 'For years I have been afflicted with a scourging hemorrhage. I have suffered many things from many physicians; I have spent all my substance, but none could cure me. Then I heard of you, and I thought if I may but touch the hem of his garment, I shall certainly be made whole. And so I pressed forward with the crowd as it moved along until, standing near you, Master, I touched the border of your garment, and I was made whole; I know that I have been healed of my affliction.'" (UB 152:0.2)

Again, the UB says the Adjuster is the most divine affection in all creation, which even the authors of the UB regard as miraculous.

> "As far as I am conversant with the affairs of a universe, I regard the love and devotion of a Thought Adjuster as the most truly divine affection in all creation. The love of the Sons in their ministry to the races is superb, but the devotion of an Adjuster to the individual is touchingly sublime, divinely Fatherlike." (UB 110:0.2)

---

## Principle 4

> "All miracles mean life, and God is the Giver of life. His Voice will direct you very specifically. You will be told all you need to know." (Tx:1.4)

The Thought Adjuster is God living within us. Jesus took years to perfect his communication with his Adjuster. This Course is his summary of what he learned during his life in the flesh. That is why I believe these two books complement each other so perfectly. We can see from the account of Jesus' life in the UB how he accomplished what he is teaching us in the Course.

> "And indirectly and unrecognized the Adjuster is constantly communicating with the human subject, especially during those sublime experiences of the worshipful contact of mind with spirit in the superconsciousness." (UB 110:1.1)

> "These heavenly helpers are dedicated to the stupendous task of guiding you safely inward and upward to the celestial haven of happiness. These tireless toilers are consecrated to the future personification of the triumph of divine truth in your life everlasting. They are the watchful workers who pilot the God-conscious human mind away from the shoals of evil while expertly guiding the evolving soul of man toward the divine harbors of perfection on far-distant and eternal shores. The Adjusters are loving leaders, your safe and sure guides through the dark and uncertain mazes of your short earthly career; they are the patient teachers who so constantly urge their subjects forward in the paths of progressive perfection. They are the careful custodians of the sublime values of creature character. I wish you could love them more, co-operate with them more fully, and cherish them more affectionately." (UB 110:1.2)

---

## Principle 5

> "Miracles are habits and should be involuntary. They should not be under conscious control. Consciously selected miracles can be misguided." (Tx:1.5)

Many religious people to this day try to perform miracles at will. This miracle principle is a good example of why this Course is inspired by Jesus. The apostles tried to imitate Jesus' healing approach. But they failed miserably to heal a young boy.

> "If it has been given you to do these works, I pray that you will speak those words which will deliver my child from this bondage.' Then Simon stepped forward and, placing his hand on the head of the child, looked directly into his eyes and commanded: 'Come out of him, you unclean spirit; in the name of Jesus obey me.' But the lad had only a more violent fit, while the scribes mocked the apostles in derision, and the disappointed believers suffered the taunts of these unfriendly critics." (UB 158:4.6)

After Simon's defeat, Jesus showed up and heard the story. This was his reply: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I bear with you? How long shall I be with you? How long ere you learn that the works of faith come not forth at the bidding of doubting unbelief?"

Later in the next section, Jesus gave the apostles a short lecture on how they were misguided. As part of his explanation he said:

> "How long will it take you to learn that you cannot time-shorten the course of established natural phenomena except when such things are in accordance with the Father's will? Nor can you do spiritual work in the absence of spiritual power. And you can do neither of these, even when their potential is present, without the existence of that third and essential human factor, the personal experience of the possession of living faith." (UB 158:6.4)

What I found most interesting about this quote was Jesus' own reference to "time-shorten" in reference to their attempt to heal the boy. The Course and UB both use that language in relation to miracles.

Another example of unconscious healing by Jesus:

> "When Jesus heard this, he took the woman by the hand and, lifting her up, said: 'Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace.' It was her faith and not her touch that made her whole. And this case is a good illustration of many apparently miraculous cures which attended upon Jesus' earth career, but which he in no sense consciously willed." (UB 152:0.3)

---

## Principle 6

> "Miracles are natural. When they do not occur, something has gone wrong." (Tx:1.6)

At first glance this looks out of step with the UB. The UB tells us we progress from age to age and slowly eliminate disease and slowly mature as a planet. Surely miracles are not natural for our current period. But no one statement stands alone. The very next principle says purification is necessary first. It is a process. So miracles are natural once purification is complete. On the other hand, we are out of step with the normal plan of creation due to the Lucifer rebellion, so we have limited knowledge of how life would be in our age had we not suffered through a rebellion. On a normal world we would have visible celestial leaders and celestial communications. It may be that by now we would see miracles occur on a daily basis. After all, Jesus did show us what is possible while living his life in the flesh.

> "Evolutionary mortals inhabiting normal worlds of spiritual progress do not experience the acute conflicts between the spirit and the flesh which characterize the present-day Urantia races. But even on the most ideal planets, pre-Adamic man must put forth positive efforts to ascend from the purely animalistic plane of existence up through successive levels of increasingly intellectual meanings and higher spiritual values." (UB 34:7.2)

> "The mortals of a normal world do not experience constant warfare between their physical and spiritual natures. They are confronted with the necessity of climbing up from the animal levels of existence to the higher planes of spiritual living, but this ascent is more like undergoing an educational training when compared with the intense conflicts of Urantia mortals in this realm of the divergent material and spiritual natures." (UB 34:7.3)

---

## Principle 7

> "Miracles are everyone's right, but purification is necessary first." (Tx:1.7)

We have a few examples of Jesus making reference to having a pure heart in relation to miracles. This quote from the UB followed a story of a healing that had just happened:

> "He did not want Veronica to go away thinking that her fear in attempting to steal her cure had been honored, or that her superstition in associating the touch of his garment with her healing had been effective. He desired all to know that it was her pure and living faith that had wrought the cure." (UB 152:0.3)

Another quote referring to Jesus' teachings references a pure heart:

> "He only advised man to humble himself that he might become truly exalted; what he really aimed at was true humility toward God. He placed great value upon sincerity, a pure heart. Fidelity was a cardinal virtue in his estimate of character, while courage was the very heart of his teachings. 'Fear not' was his watchword, and patient endurance his ideal of strength of character." (UB 140:8.20)

---

## Principle 8

> "Miracles are [a form of] healing. They supply a lack, and they are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less." (Tx:1.8)

The apostles discovered that their message carried healing for the afflicted. They acquired something unique during their association with Jesus that had a positive effect on those ministered to. They temporarily had more and freely shared it.

> "The apostles did some public work in Jericho, but their efforts were chiefly of a more quiet and personal nature. They now made the discovery that the good news of the kingdom was very comforting to the sick; that their message carried healing for the afflicted. And it was in Jericho that Jesus' commission to the twelve to preach the glad tidings of the kingdom and minister to the afflicted was first fully carried into effect." (UB 141:8.2)

---

## Principle 9

> "Miracles are a kind of exchange. Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. They bring more love both to the giver and the receiver." (Tx:1.9)

This UB quote below seems a little harsh in that it says "from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken away." But these are the words of Jesus in the UB. It highlights a universal law. If we share love we increase both the giver's and receiver's possession of love. If we hold back from sharing, it is like clogged plumbing. The Course is attempting to lay out an almost scientific process we can use to unclog the plumbing.

> "To every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken away. You cannot stand still in the affairs of the eternal kingdom. My Father requires all his children to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. You who know these truths must yield the increase of the fruits of the spirit and manifest a growing devotion to the unselfish service of your fellow servants. And remember that, inasmuch as you minister to one of the least of my brethren, you have done this service to me." (UB 176:3.5)

---

## Principle 10

> "The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is wrong, or better, is a misunderstanding of their purpose. They are really used for and by believers." (Tx:1.10)

I have occasionally heard criticism that Jesus would never have dictated a course in miracles because he did not want to use miracles to win over believers. But this miracle principle and the UB quote both say faith is shared to reinforce and grow the faith of believers.

> "The God-knowing man describes his spiritual experiences, not to convince unbelievers, but for the edification and mutual satisfaction of believers." (UB 1:6.6)

This quote also suggests there is a proper role for miracles:

> "When the Creator himself was on earth, incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh, it was inevitable that some extraordinary things should happen. But you should never approach Jesus through these so-called miraculous occurrences. Learn to approach the miracle through Jesus, but do not make the mistake of approaching Jesus through the miracle." (UB 149:2.7)

---

## Principle 11

> "Prayer is the medium of miracles. Prayer is the natural communication of the created with the Creator. Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed." (Tx:1.11)

We know from the Urantia Book that miracles occur when our will is in accord with God's will, and our prayers will be answered. These similarities are pretty amazing.

> "When you have become wholly dedicated to the doing of the will of the Father in heaven, the answer to all your petitions will be forthcoming because your prayers will be in full accordance with the Father's will, and the Father's will is ever manifest throughout his vast universe. What the true son desires and the infinite Father wills IS. Such a prayer cannot remain unanswered, and no other sort of petition can possibly be fully answered." (UB 146:2.7)

> "Prayer is entirely a personal and spontaneous expression of the attitude of the soul toward the spirit; prayer should be the communion of sonship and the expression of fellowship. Prayer, when indited by the spirit, leads to co-operative spiritual progress. The ideal prayer is a form of spiritual communion which leads to intelligent worship. True praying is the sincere attitude of reaching heavenward for the attainment of your ideals." (UB 144:2.2)

---

## Principle 12

> "Miracles are thoughts. Thoughts can represent lower-order or higher-order reality. This is the basic distinction between intellectualizing and thinking. One makes the physical and the other creates the spiritual, and we believe in what we make or create." (Tx:1.12)

I certainly have not figured out this mysterious connection between the Course and the UB. This is an effort to put what I see out there for others to correct or build on. The path to the "final Father" as Jesus demonstrated in his life in the flesh is a difficult path but achievable in this short life. If it were easy it would not be so abstract.

In the words of the UB, lower-order reality is made up of the seven adjutants where the ego lives, and the higher mind is the morontia and spiritual reality where the Adjuster lives. It does seem to use the terms "make" and "create" to distinguish temporal and eternal.

> "Aside from all that is superself in the experience of praying, it should be remembered that ethical prayer is a splendid way to elevate one's ego and reinforce the self for better living and higher attainment. Prayer induces the human ego to look both ways for help: for material aid to the subconscious reservoir of mortal experience, for inspiration and guidance to the superconscious borders of the contact of the material with the spiritual, with the Mystery Monitor." (UB 91:3.5)

---

## Principle 13

> "Miracles are both beginnings and endings. They thus alter the temporal order. They are always affirmations of rebirth which seem to go back but really go forward. They undo the past in the present and thus release the future." (Tx:1.13)

I cannot say I understand this concept of altering the temporal order, but I can find similar language in the Urantia Book that matches this principle. Quite a brain teaser.

> "The time unit of immaturity concentrates meaning-value into the present moment in such a way as to divorce the present of its true relationship to the not-present, the past-future. The time unit of maturity is proportioned so to reveal the co-ordinate relationship of past-present-future that the self begins to gain insight into the wholeness of events, begins to view the landscape of time from the panoramic perspective of broadened horizons, begins perhaps to suspect the nonbeginning, nonending eternal continuum, the fragments of which are called time." (UB 118:1.8)

And I have always liked this quote saying we are not altogether bound by the limits of time:

> "The human mind early begins to manifest qualities which are supermaterial; the truly reflective human intellect is not altogether bound by the limits of time." (UB 133:7.11)

---

## Principle 14

> "Miracles bear witness to truth. They are convincing because they arise from conviction. Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive, or rather the uncreative use of mind." (Tx:1.14)

"Miracles bear witness to the truth. They are convincing because they arise from conviction."

> "Said Jesus: 'I have told you about myself and my Father many times, but you will not believe me. Can you not see that the works I do in my Father's name bear witness for me?'" (UB 164:5.2)

"Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive, or rather the uncreative use of mind." Here the UB makes a similar statement that the mystical state is destructive:

> "The more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. The direct communion with one's Thought Adjuster, such as occurred in the later years of Jesus' life in the flesh, should not be confused with these so-called mystical experiences. The factors which contribute to the initiation of mystic communion are indicative of the danger of such psychic states. The mystic status is favored by such things as: physical fatigue, fasting, psychic dissociation, profound aesthetic experiences, vivid sex impulses, fear, anxiety, rage, and wild dancing. Much of the material arising as a result of such preliminary preparation has its origin in the subconscious mind." (UB 100:5.10)

---

## Principle 15

> "Each day should be devoted to miracles. The purpose of time is to enable man to learn to use it constructively. Time is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. It will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning." (Tx:1.15)

Time is a teaching device and a means to create God the Supreme. God the Supreme is the God of time and space. He is evolving, but it is important to remember there will come a time when God the Supreme will be complete. There will be no need for time since all potentials will be exhausted in time. The seven superuniverses will be settled in light and life and the Almighty Supreme will flash into existence all at once. At that moment we will all simultaneously discover God the Almighty Supreme. This is also the concept spoken of in JCIM when referring to the Sonship. To understand the Course's perspective on Sonship and time, it is important to understand the Urantia Book's concept of God the Supreme and our part in it. They both say the same thing. How amazing is that?

> "There will come an end sometime to the growth of the Supreme; his status will achieve completion (in the energy-spirit sense). This termination of the evolution of the Supreme will also witness the ending of creature evolution as a part of Supremacy." (UB 117:2.6)

> "We have long held, however, that the present growth which characterizes creature existence in the present universe age is a function of the Supreme. We equally hold that this kind of growth is peculiar to the age of the growth of the Supreme, and that it will terminate with the completion of the growth of the Supreme." (UB 117:2.2)

---

## Principle 16

> "Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating that it is more blessed to give than to receive. They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver." (Tx:1.16)

The Course states things in a slightly more legalistic manner, but this miracle principle definitely overlaps. There are five occurrences of the statement "it is more blessed to give than to receive" in the UB. This kind of giving is so rewarding if we can learn how and what to give. Forgiveness is the ultimate gift according to the Course. Let the miracles flow.

> "The Master was always generous. He never grew weary of saying, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Said he, 'Freely you have received, freely give.' And yet, with all of his unbounded generosity, he was never wasteful or extravagant. He taught that you must believe to receive salvation. 'For every one who seeks shall receive.'" (UB 100:7.10)

---

## Principle 17

> "Miracles are the transcendence of the body. They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from a sense of lower-order reality. That is why they heal." (Tx:1.17)

A shift away from lower-order reality: that is a strange thing to say. We know from both the UB and CIM that miracles alter time in some way, both saying it shortens time. Here the UB says personality will makes it possible to transcend the material sequence of temporal events, which makes miracles possible.

> "On the inhabited worlds, human personality (indwelt and oriented by the Paradise Father's spirit) is the only physically related reality which can transcend the material sequence of temporal events." (UB 130:7.4)

---

## Principle 18

> "A miracle is a service. It is the maximal service one individual can render another. It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself. The doer recognizes his own and his neighbor's inestimable worth simultaneously." (Tx:1.18)

Love your brother as yourself and miracles will flow.

> "Then the Master discoursed at some length on the earthly family as an illustration of the heavenly family, restating the two fundamental laws of living: the first commandment of love for the father, the head of the family, and the second commandment of mutual love among the children, to love your brother as yourself. And then he explained that such a quality of brotherly affection would invariably manifest itself in unselfish and loving social service." (UB 142:7.4)

---

## Principle 19

> "[Miracles make Souls one in Christ.] They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all the Souls God created. Miracles therefore rest on the laws of eternity, not of time." (Tx:1.19)

In CIM, Jesus describes the Sonship as the sum of all souls created by God. The Urantia Book describes the Supreme as the sum total of all finite growth, or the synthetic cumulative total.

> "The far-flung diversification of eternal energy, divine spirit, and universal mind attains finite culmination in the evolution of the Supreme, who is the sum total of all finite growth." (UB 117:3.1)

> "The parts and individuals of the grand universe evolve as a reflection of the total evolution of the Supreme, while in turn the Supreme is the synthetic cumulative total of all grand universe evolution." (UB 117:0.4)

---

## Principle 20

> "Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. This is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the miracle." (Tx:1.20)

> "Those who have received and recognized the indwelling of God have been born of the Spirit. 'You are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwells in you.' It is not enough that this spirit be poured out upon you; the divine Spirit must dominate and control every phase of human experience." (UB 34:6.7)

---

## Principle 21

> "Miracles are natural expressions of total forgiveness. Through miracles, man accepts God's forgiveness by extending it to others." (Tx:1.21)

Forgiveness is an absolute central theme throughout the Course. It is the central theme to removing the blocks to love. With the UB we have the master plan of creation. The purpose of all this temporal existence is the creation of God the Supreme (and making the Sonship whole in CIM). We will one day all join and discover God the Supreme (Sonship) at the same moment. Each one of us is an irreplaceable part of the Sonship. How does this play a role in our forgiveness? The Course says simply see each of us as either full of love or lacking in love. If we see a lack, the natural response will be to fill that lack. No need to judge anyone as guilty, but instead lacking. If we are able to fill a lack in someone else, we experience the fullness of love in ourselves. That I would call a miracle. This makes the idea of service appealing because it opens up channels to the higher mind (Holy Spirit) we cannot access any other way. So knowledge of the master plan is a motivation to see our brothers in a different light, an irreplaceable part of what we are here to accomplish.

> "Where could your peace arise but from forgiveness? The Christ in you looks only on the truth and sees no condemnation that could need forgiveness. He is at peace because He sees no sin." (JCIM Tx:24.42)

> "Even the forgiveness of sin operates in this same unerring fashion. The Father in heaven has forgiven you even before you have thought to ask him, but such forgiveness is not available in your personal religious experience until such a time as you forgive your fellow men. God's forgiveness in fact is not conditioned upon your forgiving your fellows, but in experience it is exactly so conditioned." (UB 146:2.4)

---

## Principles 22-24

> "22. Miracles are associated with fear only because of the fallacious belief that darkness can hide. Man believes that what he cannot see does not exist, and his physical eyes cannot see in the dark. This is a very primitive solution and has led to a denial of the Spiritual eye. The escape from darkness involves two stages:
>
> A. (23) The recognition that darkness cannot hide. This step usually entails fear.
>
> B. (24) The recognition that there is nothing you want to hide, even if you could. This step brings escape from fear." (Tx:1.22-24)

At first glance this principle seems so abstract. How is fear linked to this idea that darkness can hide us? I remember reading in the Course that there are no private thoughts. When I read it I did not like that idea. This is the source of fear.

> "Today we are again emphasizing the fact that minds are joined. This is rarely a wholly welcome idea at first, since it seems to carry with it an enormous sense of responsibility and may even be regarded as an 'invasion of privacy.' Yet it is a fact that there are no private thoughts. Despite your initial resistance to this idea, you will yet understand that it must be true if salvation is possible at all. And salvation must be possible because it is the Will of God." (JCIM W1:19.2)

But it is true. Minds are linked, and the UB also says this. When our mind rises up above the seven adjutant mind spirits and connects to the Holy Spirit (spiritual eye), we all share that mind. The UB also says we have no private thoughts, and there are special beings who know our every thought.

> "The real nature of any service, be it rendered by man or angel, is fully revealed in the faces of these secoraphic service indicators, the Sanctities of Service. The full analysis of the true and of the hidden motives is clearly shown. These angels are indeed the mind readers, heart searchers, and soul revealers of the universe. Mortals may employ words to conceal their thoughts, but these high seconaphim lay bare the deep motives of the human heart and of the angelic mind." (UB 28:6.19)

Our angels and Thought Adjusters are also keenly aware of our thoughts. So this principle is in complete agreement with the UB. For those who welcome this seeming intrusion into our personal lives, fear should be lessened.

---

## Principle 23

> "Miracles rearrange perception and place the levels of perception in true perspective. This heals at all levels because sickness comes from confusing the levels." (Tx:1.25)

I cannot comment on the mechanisms that are at work here to correct these levels of perception, but we do know levels exist from reading the UB. Beginning at the non-teachable levels of mechanical mind, to the seven adjutants, up through the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, to the cosmic mind. What I am learning through this study is that forgiveness is essential to open our minds to these higher levels of superconsciousness. And through Jesus' life we see that when we reach these levels of awareness, miracles do naturally happen.

The Course says: "Only eternity is real. Why not use the illusion of time constructively?"

Some Urantia Book readers have a problem with the Course because it makes statements like that. Yet we can find many references to the eternal perspective in the UB that says they consider the material world almost entirely unreal. The opposing views of time and eternity make the transition from one to the other confusing to say the least. The Course is an attempt to help us make that transition. Since time has an expiration date, at least in the sense that we will exhaust all possibilities of time with the creation of the Supreme, what language would you use if you were in eternity and looking on time from that perspective? Is it logical for eternal beings to reference time as an illusion? They certainly do in the UB with statements like: "To material beings the spirit world is more or less unreal; to spirit beings the material world is almost entirely unreal, being merely a shadow of the substance of spirit realities."

> "The time-space concept of a mind of material origin is destined to undergo successive enlargements as the conscious and conceiving personality ascends the levels of the universes. When man attains the mind intervening between the material and the spiritual planes of existence, his ideas of time-space will be enormously expanded both as to quality of perception and quantity of experience. And as personality passes on, upward and inward, to the transcendental levels of Deity-likeness, the time-space concept will increasingly approximate the timeless and spaceless concepts of the Absolutes." (UB 130:7.8)

---

## Principle 24

> "Miracles enable man to heal the sick and raise the dead, because he made sickness and death himself and can abolish both. You are a miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator. Everything else is only your own nightmare and does not exist. Only the creations of light are real." (Tx:1.27)

This certainly seems at odds with the UB: "he made sickness and death himself and can abolish it." I was not even born when Lucifer rebelled. I always wondered why our planet was put in isolation for Lucifer's rebellion and Adam and Eve's default. It seems unfair to make the inhabitants of a planet pay for the errors of others. But how does this look from the eternal perspective? The Course emphasizes our oneness with the Sonship as a major change in viewpoint from our individualized ego perspective. We are linked together in ways we cannot totally understand. The UB provides incredible details about our interconnectedness. But do we truly get it? The CIM puts the responsibility on us collectively for getting into this mess and places the power to correct it squarely within our collective minds. We do have the power to transcend the current misery and rise above it. The only answer to this seeming conflict between the UB and CIM is that we are all one in the grand scheme. We are all part of the Supreme Being. We are downstream from the Lucifer rebellion and the Adamic default, but we are still being held accountable in some way that only makes sense from the eternal perspective. It can certainly be said that Lucifer created sickness and death. Here is similar language in the UB:

> "And it was with such a Declaration of Liberty that Lucifer launched his orgy of darkness and death." (UB 53:3.7)

I suggest that what this principle is saying is that we collectively as the Sonship create sickness and death, and we can correct it. This may be the perspective from eternity.

"You are a miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator." The UB quote below says pretty much the same thing:

> "Mortal man is more than figuratively made in the image of God. From a physical standpoint this statement is hardly true, but with reference to certain universe potentialities it is an actual fact. In the human race, something of the same drama of evolutionary attainment is being unfolded as takes place, on a vastly larger scale, in the universe of universes. Man, a volitional personality, becomes creative in liaison with an Adjuster, an impersonal entity, in the presence of the finite potentialities of the Supreme, and the result is the flowering of an immortal soul." (UB 117:3.5)

"Only the creations of light are real." The UB says most of what we believe is scaffolding. What is real will be preserved within our soul:

> "Conceptual frames of the universe are only relatively true; they are serviceable scaffolding which must eventually give way before the expansions of enlarging cosmic comprehension." (UB 115:1.2)

---

## Principle 25

> "Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the Atonement. This process works all the time and in all the dimensions of time." (Tx:1.28)

From the Course: "I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. When you offer a miracle unto any of my brothers, you do it unto yourself and me. The reason you come before me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail temporarily. The purpose of my part in the Atonement is the canceling out of all lacks of love which men could not otherwise correct. The word 'sin' should be changed to 'lack of love' because 'sin' is a man-made word with threat connotations which he made up himself. No real threat is involved anywhere. Nothing is gained by frightening yourselves, and it is very destructive to do so."

The UB uses our limited language, and some UB authors express frustration with the limitations of our language. They describe sin in great detail. But herein lies the paradox. Spirit beings say the material world is almost entirely unreal to them. If they consider the material world unreal, what do you think their attitude towards sin is? Does God recognize sin? The UB says he has already forgiven us even before we ask. Jesus is telling us the eternal view of sin. He thinks of it as a lack of love, and our only response is to fill it. This attitude takes judgment out of the picture. The only response is to fill the lack with love.

*Note: Principles 26-50 will be developed in a future edition of this study guide. The remaining principles continue the themes introduced here: the relationship between miracles and time, the role of forgiveness, the connection between the giver and receiver, and the ultimate goal of restoring awareness of our oneness with God.*
