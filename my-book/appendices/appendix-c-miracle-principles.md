# Appendix C: CIM Miracle Principles with UB Parallels

The first chapter of the Course in Miracles lays out fifty principles of miracles. These principles contain stunning parallels to concepts found in The Urantia Book. Below are the first twenty-five principles, each paired with relevant UB passages and commentary showing how these two revelations illuminate the same truths from different angles.

Principles 26-50 will be added in a future edition.

---

## Principle 1

> "There is no order of difficulty among miracles. One is not 'harder' or 'bigger' than another. They are all the same. All expressions of love are maximal." (Tx:1.1)

Miracles come from God, not from us. To an infinite being there is no small miracle or large miracle. The difficulty we perceive is our own projection. The only variable is the gap between our will and God's will. Close that gap and all expressions of love flow equally.

> "With our heavenly Father all things are possible. Since he is the Creator, having made all things and all beings, it could not be otherwise." (UB 131:10.2)

> "When you have become wholly dedicated to the doing of the will of the Father in heaven, the answer to all your petitions will be forthcoming because your prayers will be in full accordance with the Father's will, and the Father's will is ever manifest throughout his vast universe. What the true son desires and the infinite Father wills IS. Such a prayer cannot remain unanswered, and no other sort of petition can possibly be fully answered." (UB 146:2.7)

---

## Principle 2

> "Miracles as such do not matter. The only thing that matters is their Source, Which is far beyond human evaluation." (Tx:1.2)

The source of miracles is the Adjuster, and the Adjuster is far beyond human evaluation. We know this because in Paper 136, Jesus negotiated the terms of his public ministry directly with his Personalized Adjuster. He could limit the celestial hosts in space, but his Adjuster made clear that their function in time could not be overridden. Jesus had to remain "constantly time conscious" to prevent miracles from happening involuntarily. The miracle itself is not the point. The indwelling source that makes it possible is.

> "In accepting this command of the universe hosts in attendance upon Christ Michael, the Personalized Adjuster took great pains to point out to Jesus that, while such an assembly of universe creatures could be limited in their space activities by the delegated authority of their Creator, such limitations were not operative in connection with their function in time." (UB 136:5.4)

> "In order to prevent the appearance of apparent time miracles, it was necessary for Jesus to remain constantly time conscious. Any lapse of time consciousness on his part, in connection with the entertainment of definite desire, was equivalent to the enactment of the thing conceived in the mind of this Creator Son, and without the intervention of time." (UB 136:5.5)

---

## Principle 3

> "Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. The real miracle is the love that inspires them. In this sense, everything that comes from love is a miracle." (Tx:1.3)

The Course says the real miracle is not the healing but the love behind it. The UB illustrates this perfectly. When a woman touched the hem of Jesus' garment and was healed, Jesus was completely unaware it happened. He did not decide to heal her. The love pouring through him was so natural, so constant, that healing occurred without his conscious will. That is what a miracle looks like when love flows without obstruction.

> "And when those who were near him denied that they had touched him, Peter spoke up: 'Master, you can see that this crowd presses you, threatening to crush us, and yet you say someone has touched me.' ... As Jesus looked about him, his eyes fell upon a near-by woman, who, coming forward, knelt at his feet and said: 'For years I have been afflicted with a scourging hemorrhage. I have suffered many things from many physicians; I have spent all my substance, but none could cure me. Then I heard of you, and I thought if I may but touch the hem of his garment, I shall certainly be made whole. And so I pressed forward with the crowd as it moved along until, standing near you, Master, I touched the border of your garment, and I was made whole; I know that I have been healed of my affliction.'" (UB 152:0.2)

And what is the source of that love? A Thought Adjuster so devoted that even a high universe being calls it "the most truly divine affection in all creation."

> "As far as I am conversant with the affairs of a universe, I regard the love and devotion of a Thought Adjuster as the most truly divine affection in all creation. The love of the Sons in their ministry to the races is superb, but the devotion of an Adjuster to the individual is touchingly sublime, divinely Fatherlike." (UB 110:0.2)

---

## Principle 4

> "All miracles mean life, and God is the Giver of life. His Voice will direct you very specifically. You will be told all you need to know." (Tx:1.4)

The Course says God's Voice will direct you very specifically. That Voice is the Thought Adjuster, God literally living within us. Jesus spent years perfecting his communication with his Adjuster during his life in the flesh. The Course is his summary of what he learned. The UB shows us how he did it. These two books complement each other because one teaches the method and the other shows the demonstration.

> "And indirectly and unrecognized the Adjuster is constantly communicating with the human subject, especially during those sublime experiences of the worshipful contact of mind with spirit in the superconsciousness." (UB 110:1.1)

The Adjuster is already communicating with us, constantly. The challenge is learning to hear it. The authors of the UB plead with us to cooperate more fully with this loving guide.

> "These heavenly helpers are dedicated to the stupendous task of guiding you safely inward and upward to the celestial haven of happiness. These tireless toilers are consecrated to the future personification of the triumph of divine truth in your life everlasting. They are the watchful workers who pilot the God-conscious human mind away from the shoals of evil while expertly guiding the evolving soul of man toward the divine harbors of perfection on far-distant and eternal shores. The Adjusters are loving leaders, your safe and sure guides through the dark and uncertain mazes of your short earthly career; they are the patient teachers who so constantly urge their subjects forward in the paths of progressive perfection. They are the careful custodians of the sublime values of creature character. I wish you could love them more, co-operate with them more fully, and cherish them more affectionately." (UB 110:1.2)

---

## Principle 5

> "Miracles are habits and should be involuntary. They should not be under conscious control. Consciously selected miracles can be misguided." (Tx:1.5)

The apostles learned this lesson the hard way. They tried to consciously perform a healing on a young boy and failed completely.

> "If it has been given you to do these works, I pray that you will speak those words which will deliver my child from this bondage.' Then Simon stepped forward and, placing his hand on the head of the child, looked directly into his eyes and commanded: 'Come out of him, you unclean spirit; in the name of Jesus obey me.' But the lad had only a more violent fit, while the scribes mocked the apostles in derision, and the disappointed believers suffered the taunts of these unfriendly critics." (UB 158:4.6)

Jesus rebuked them: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I bear with you?" Then he explained exactly why they failed. You cannot consciously force a miracle. It requires alignment with the Father's will, the presence of spiritual power, and living faith. All three, or nothing happens.

> "How long will it take you to learn that you cannot time-shorten the course of established natural phenomena except when such things are in accordance with the Father's will? Nor can you do spiritual work in the absence of spiritual power. And you can do neither of these, even when their potential is present, without the existence of that third and essential human factor, the personal experience of the possession of living faith." (UB 158:6.4)

Notice Jesus uses the word "time-shorten" here, the same language the Course uses when describing what miracles do. Now contrast the apostles' failure with how Jesus himself healed. He did not consciously will it. It flowed through him naturally.

> "When Jesus heard this, he took the woman by the hand and, lifting her up, said: 'Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace.' It was her faith and not her touch that made her whole. And this case is a good illustration of many apparently miraculous cures which attended upon Jesus' earth career, but which he in no sense consciously willed." (UB 152:0.3)

---

## Principle 6

> "Miracles are natural. When they do not occur, something has gone wrong." (Tx:1.6)

This sounds bold until you consider our situation. Something has gone wrong on this planet. The Lucifer rebellion threw us out of step with the normal plan of creation. On a normal world, mortals do not experience the constant warfare between spirit and flesh that we do. Their ascent is more like an educational training than a battle. We have no way of knowing what life would look like on our world had the rebellion never happened. Miracles may well be the natural state we were designed for. Jesus showed us what is possible when nothing has gone wrong inside.

> "Evolutionary mortals inhabiting normal worlds of spiritual progress do not experience the acute conflicts between the spirit and the flesh which characterize the present-day Urantia races. But even on the most ideal planets, pre-Adamic man must put forth positive efforts to ascend from the purely animalistic plane of existence up through successive levels of increasingly intellectual meanings and higher spiritual values." (UB 34:7.2)

> "The mortals of a normal world do not experience constant warfare between their physical and spiritual natures. They are confronted with the necessity of climbing up from the animal levels of existence to the higher planes of spiritual living, but this ascent is more like undergoing an educational training when compared with the intense conflicts of Urantia mortals in this realm of the divergent material and spiritual natures." (UB 34:7.3)

---

## Principle 7

> "Miracles are everyone's right, but purification is necessary first." (Tx:1.7)

Not just for saints or special people. Everyone. But the channel has to be clear. Jesus made this point after the woman was healed by touching his garment. It was not superstition or magic that healed her. It was her "pure and living faith."

> "He did not want Veronica to go away thinking that her fear in attempting to steal her cure had been honored, or that her superstition in associating the touch of his garment with her healing had been effective. He desired all to know that it was her pure and living faith that had wrought the cure." (UB 152:0.3)

Jesus valued sincerity and a pure heart above almost everything else. Purification is not punishment. It is preparation.

> "He only advised man to humble himself that he might become truly exalted; what he really aimed at was true humility toward God. He placed great value upon sincerity, a pure heart. Fidelity was a cardinal virtue in his estimate of character, while courage was the very heart of his teachings. 'Fear not' was his watchword, and patient endurance his ideal of strength of character." (UB 140:8.20)

---

## Principle 8

> "Miracles are [a form of] healing. They supply a lack, and they are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less." (Tx:1.8)

The apostles discovered this firsthand in Jericho. Their message itself carried healing. By spending time with Jesus they had acquired something they could share, and those who received it were comforted and healed. They temporarily had more and gave freely to those who had less. That is the miracle in action.

> "The apostles did some public work in Jericho, but their efforts were chiefly of a more quiet and personal nature. They now made the discovery that the good news of the kingdom was very comforting to the sick; that their message carried healing for the afflicted. And it was in Jericho that Jesus' commission to the twelve to preach the glad tidings of the kingdom and minister to the afflicted was first fully carried into effect." (UB 141:8.2)

---

## Principle 9

> "Miracles are a kind of exchange. Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. They bring more love both to the giver and the receiver." (Tx:1.9)

In the material world, giving means you have less. In the spiritual world, giving means everyone has more. This is the reversal of physical laws the Course is describing. Jesus stated the same universal law plainly: to those who give, more is given. To those who hold back, even what they have is taken away. Love is not a fixed quantity. It multiplies through sharing.

> "To every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken away. You cannot stand still in the affairs of the eternal kingdom. My Father requires all his children to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. You who know these truths must yield the increase of the fruits of the spirit and manifest a growing devotion to the unselfish service of your fellow servants. And remember that, inasmuch as you minister to one of the least of my brethren, you have done this service to me." (UB 176:3.5)

---

## Principle 10

> "The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is wrong, or better, is a misunderstanding of their purpose. They are really used for and by believers." (Tx:1.10)

Some critics say Jesus would never have authored a course about miracles because he did not want miracles used as spectacles. But this principle says exactly the same thing. Miracles are not for convincing skeptics. They are for believers. The UB agrees: spiritual experience is shared "for the edification and mutual satisfaction of believers," not to win arguments.

> "The God-knowing man describes his spiritual experiences, not to convince unbelievers, but for the edification and mutual satisfaction of believers." (UB 1:6.6)

The proper relationship is to approach the miracle through Jesus, never the other way around.

> "When the Creator himself was on earth, incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh, it was inevitable that some extraordinary things should happen. But you should never approach Jesus through these so-called miraculous occurrences. Learn to approach the miracle through Jesus, but do not make the mistake of approaching Jesus through the miracle." (UB 149:2.7)

---

## Principle 11

> "Prayer is the medium of miracles. Prayer is the natural communication of the created with the Creator. Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed." (Tx:1.11)

The Course describes a simple circuit: prayer connects us to God, love flows in, and miracles flow out. The UB describes the same circuit. When our will aligns with the Father's will through prayer, "what the true son desires and the infinite Father wills IS." Prayer is not begging. It is communion. And that communion is what opens the channel for miracles.

> "When you have become wholly dedicated to the doing of the will of the Father in heaven, the answer to all your petitions will be forthcoming because your prayers will be in full accordance with the Father's will, and the Father's will is ever manifest throughout his vast universe. What the true son desires and the infinite Father wills IS. Such a prayer cannot remain unanswered, and no other sort of petition can possibly be fully answered." (UB 146:2.7)

> "Prayer is entirely a personal and spontaneous expression of the attitude of the soul toward the spirit; prayer should be the communion of sonship and the expression of fellowship. Prayer, when indited by the spirit, leads to co-operative spiritual progress. The ideal prayer is a form of spiritual communion which leads to intelligent worship. True praying is the sincere attitude of reaching heavenward for the attainment of your ideals." (UB 144:2.2)

---

## Principle 12

> "Miracles are thoughts. Thoughts can represent lower-order or higher-order reality. This is the basic distinction between intellectualizing and thinking. One makes the physical and the other creates the spiritual, and we believe in what we make or create." (Tx:1.12)

The Course draws a sharp line between two kinds of thought. Lower-order thought "makes" the physical. Higher-order thought "creates" the spiritual. The UB maps to this distinction. The seven adjutant mind spirits govern the lower mind where the ego lives. The superconscious mind is where we contact the Adjuster. Prayer is described as the bridge between them, inducing the ego to look upward toward the spiritual for inspiration and guidance.

> "Aside from all that is superself in the experience of praying, it should be remembered that ethical prayer is a splendid way to elevate one's ego and reinforce the self for better living and higher attainment. Prayer induces the human ego to look both ways for help: for material aid to the subconscious reservoir of mortal experience, for inspiration and guidance to the superconscious borders of the contact of the material with the spiritual, with the Mystery Monitor." (UB 91:3.5)

---

## Principle 13

> "Miracles are both beginnings and endings. They thus alter the temporal order. They are always affirmations of rebirth which seem to go back but really go forward. They undo the past in the present and thus release the future." (Tx:1.13)

This is one of the more mysterious principles. How can something undo the past and release the future? The UB offers a clue. An immature mind sees only the present moment, cut off from past and future. A mature mind begins to see the wholeness of events, the panoramic view where past, present, and future are coordinated. From that higher perspective, a miracle can reach back and reframe the meaning of what happened, which changes what comes next. Forgiveness does exactly this. It undoes the past in the present and releases the future.

> "The time unit of immaturity concentrates meaning-value into the present moment in such a way as to divorce the present of its true relationship to the not-present, the past-future. The time unit of maturity is proportioned so to reveal the co-ordinate relationship of past-present-future that the self begins to gain insight into the wholeness of events, begins to view the landscape of time from the panoramic perspective of broadened horizons, begins perhaps to suspect the nonbeginning, nonending eternal continuum, the fragments of which are called time." (UB 118:1.8)

The human mind is not altogether bound by time. We already have access to something beyond it.

> "The human mind early begins to manifest qualities which are supermaterial; the truly reflective human intellect is not altogether bound by the limits of time." (UB 133:7.11)

---

## Principle 14

> "Miracles bear witness to truth. They are convincing because they arise from conviction. Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive, or rather the uncreative use of mind." (Tx:1.14)

Jesus said the same thing plainly: "Can you not see that the works I do in my Father's name bear witness for me?" His miracles were convincing because they came from total conviction, total alignment with the Father's will.

> "Said Jesus: 'I have told you about myself and my Father many times, but you will not believe me. Can you not see that the works I do in my Father's name bear witness for me?'" (UB 164:5.2)

Without that conviction, miracles deteriorate into magic. The UB warns against this directly. Mystical states induced by fatigue, fasting, anxiety, or psychic dissociation are not miracles. They originate in the subconscious mind, not the superconscious. That is the "uncreative use of mind" the Course is warning about.

> "The more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. The direct communion with one's Thought Adjuster, such as occurred in the later years of Jesus' life in the flesh, should not be confused with these so-called mystical experiences. The factors which contribute to the initiation of mystic communion are indicative of the danger of such psychic states. The mystic status is favored by such things as: physical fatigue, fasting, psychic dissociation, profound aesthetic experiences, vivid sex impulses, fear, anxiety, rage, and wild dancing. Much of the material arising as a result of such preliminary preparation has its origin in the subconscious mind." (UB 100:5.10)

---

## Principle 15

> "Each day should be devoted to miracles. The purpose of time is to enable man to learn to use it constructively. Time is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. It will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning." (Tx:1.15)

The Course says time will cease when it is no longer useful. The UB says the same thing with remarkable specificity. Time exists for the growth of God the Supreme. When all potentials in time and space are exhausted and the Supreme is complete, creature evolution as we know it will end. The Course calls this the completion of the Sonship. The UB calls it the emergence of the Almighty Supreme. Both say we will all arrive at that moment together. Time is the classroom. When the lesson is learned, the classroom closes.

> "There will come an end sometime to the growth of the Supreme; his status will achieve completion (in the energy-spirit sense). This termination of the evolution of the Supreme will also witness the ending of creature evolution as a part of Supremacy." (UB 117:2.6)

> "We have long held, however, that the present growth which characterizes creature existence in the present universe age is a function of the Supreme. We equally hold that this kind of growth is peculiar to the age of the growth of the Supreme, and that it will terminate with the completion of the growth of the Supreme." (UB 117:2.2)

---

## Principle 16

> "Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating that it is more blessed to give than to receive. They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver." (Tx:1.16)

Jesus never grew weary of this teaching. The UB records him saying "it is more blessed to give than to receive" five separate times. The Course identifies forgiveness as the ultimate gift. When we forgive, we give something that strengthens both giver and receiver. That is the miracle as teaching device: it shows us through direct experience that giving and receiving are the same.

> "The Master was always generous. He never grew weary of saying, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Said he, 'Freely you have received, freely give.' And yet, with all of his unbounded generosity, he was never wasteful or extravagant. He taught that you must believe to receive salvation. 'For every one who seeks shall receive.'" (UB 100:7.10)

---

## Principle 17

> "Miracles are the transcendence of the body. They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from a sense of lower-order reality. That is why they heal." (Tx:1.17)

The Course says miracles shift us away from lower-order reality. The UB tells us what makes that shift possible. Human personality, indwelt by the Father's spirit, is the only physically related reality that can transcend the material sequence of temporal events. We are built for this transcendence. The miracle is the moment it happens.

> "On the inhabited worlds, human personality (indwelt and oriented by the Paradise Father's spirit) is the only physically related reality which can transcend the material sequence of temporal events." (UB 130:7.4)

---

## Principle 18

> "A miracle is a service. It is the maximal service one individual can render another. It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself. The doer recognizes his own and his neighbor's inestimable worth simultaneously." (Tx:1.18)

Jesus taught two fundamental laws: love for the Father and mutual love among the children. He said this quality of brotherly affection would "invariably manifest itself in unselfish and loving social service." The Course calls that service a miracle. When you truly recognize your own worth and your neighbor's worth at the same time, service is the natural result.

> "Then the Master discoursed at some length on the earthly family as an illustration of the heavenly family, restating the two fundamental laws of living: the first commandment of love for the father, the head of the family, and the second commandment of mutual love among the children, to love your brother as yourself. And then he explained that such a quality of brotherly affection would invariably manifest itself in unselfish and loving social service." (UB 142:7.4)

---

## Principle 19

> "[Miracles make Souls one in Christ.] They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all the Souls God created. Miracles therefore rest on the laws of eternity, not of time." (Tx:1.19)

The Sonship in the Course is the sum of all souls God created. The Supreme in the UB is the sum total of all finite growth. These are the same concept described in different language. Miracles rest on the laws of eternity because they serve the completion of this grand whole. Every act of cooperation between souls moves the Sonship, the Supreme, closer to completion. No individual miracle is isolated. Each one contributes to the total.

> "The far-flung diversification of eternal energy, divine spirit, and universal mind attains finite culmination in the evolution of the Supreme, who is the sum total of all finite growth." (UB 117:3.1)

> "The parts and individuals of the grand universe evolve as a reflection of the total evolution of the Supreme, while in turn the Supreme is the synthetic cumulative total of all grand universe evolution." (UB 117:0.4)

---

## Principle 20

> "Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. This is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the miracle." (Tx:1.20)

The Course says the spirit is the altar of truth. The UB says you are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwells in you. Same idea. But the UB adds something important: it is not enough that the spirit be poured out upon you. The divine Spirit must dominate and control every phase of human experience. The miracle reawakens this awareness. Healing follows when we remember where the altar actually is.

> "Those who have received and recognized the indwelling of God have been born of the Spirit. 'You are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwells in you.' It is not enough that this spirit be poured out upon you; the divine Spirit must dominate and control every phase of human experience." (UB 34:6.7)

---

## Principle 21

> "Miracles are natural expressions of total forgiveness. Through miracles, man accepts God's forgiveness by extending it to others." (Tx:1.21)

The Course says we accept God's forgiveness by extending it to others. The UB says exactly the same thing: God has already forgiven you, but you cannot experience that forgiveness until you forgive your fellows. The forgiveness already exists. The miracle is when we pass it along. Each person we encounter is either full of love or lacking in love. When we see a lack, the natural response is to fill it, not to judge. That filling is forgiveness, and that forgiveness is the miracle.

> "Where could your peace arise but from forgiveness? The Christ in you looks only on the truth and sees no condemnation that could need forgiveness. He is at peace because He sees no sin." (JCIM Tx:24.42)

> "Even the forgiveness of sin operates in this same unerring fashion. The Father in heaven has forgiven you even before you have thought to ask him, but such forgiveness is not available in your personal religious experience until such a time as you forgive your fellow men. God's forgiveness in fact is not conditioned upon your forgiving your fellows, but in experience it is exactly so conditioned." (UB 146:2.4)

---

## Principle 22

> "Miracles are associated with fear only because of the fallacious belief that darkness can hide. Man believes that what he cannot see does not exist, and his physical eyes cannot see in the dark. This is a very primitive solution and has led to a denial of the Spiritual eye. The escape from darkness involves two stages: First, the recognition that darkness cannot hide. This step usually entails fear. Second, the recognition that there is nothing you want to hide, even if you could. This step brings escape from fear." (Tx:1.22-24)

The source of fear in this principle is the belief that we can hide our thoughts. The Course states directly that there are no private thoughts, and admits this idea is rarely welcome at first.

> "Today we are again emphasizing the fact that minds are joined. This is rarely a wholly welcome idea at first, since it seems to carry with it an enormous sense of responsibility and may even be regarded as an 'invasion of privacy.' Yet it is a fact that there are no private thoughts. Despite your initial resistance to this idea, you will yet understand that it must be true if salvation is possible at all. And salvation must be possible because it is the Will of God." (JCIM W1:19.2)

The UB confirms this. There are beings in the universe who read every hidden motive of the human heart. Our Adjusters and angels are keenly aware of our thoughts. Darkness cannot hide anything. The first step is recognizing that, which brings fear. The second step is realizing you have nothing you need to hide. That is where fear ends.

> "The real nature of any service, be it rendered by man or angel, is fully revealed in the faces of these secoraphic service indicators, the Sanctities of Service. The full analysis of the true and of the hidden motives is clearly shown. These angels are indeed the mind readers, heart searchers, and soul revealers of the universe. Mortals may employ words to conceal their thoughts, but these high seconaphim lay bare the deep motives of the human heart and of the angelic mind." (UB 28:6.19)

---

## Principle 23

> "Miracles rearrange perception and place the levels of perception in true perspective. This heals at all levels because sickness comes from confusing the levels." (Tx:1.25)

The UB describes multiple levels of mind: mechanical mind, the seven adjutants, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, and cosmic mind. Sickness comes from confusing these levels, from treating lower-order perception as though it were higher-order knowledge. The miracle rearranges our perception and puts the levels back in order.

Some UB readers object when the Course calls time an illusion. But the UB itself says that to spirit beings "the material world is almost entirely unreal, being merely a shadow of the substance of spirit realities." As we ascend through the levels, our concepts of time and space expand until they approximate the timeless and spaceless concepts of the Absolutes. The Course is speaking from that higher perspective.

> "The time-space concept of a mind of material origin is destined to undergo successive enlargements as the conscious and conceiving personality ascends the levels of the universes. When man attains the mind intervening between the material and the spiritual planes of existence, his ideas of time-space will be enormously expanded both as to quality of perception and quantity of experience. And as personality passes on, upward and inward, to the transcendental levels of Deity-likeness, the time-space concept will increasingly approximate the timeless and spaceless concepts of the Absolutes." (UB 130:7.8)

---

## Principle 24

> "Miracles enable man to heal the sick and raise the dead, because he made sickness and death himself and can abolish both. You are a miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator. Everything else is only your own nightmare and does not exist. Only the creations of light are real." (Tx:1.27)

The claim that man "made sickness and death himself" does not have a clean parallel in the Urantia Book. Disease and mortality are part of evolutionary life. Humans did not create them. But the principle contains deeper truths that do align when we look at what Jesus actually demonstrated.

Jesus healed the sick. He raised the dead. These are not metaphors in the UB. They are reported events. And the mechanism behind them was not physical but mental. The universe itself is mind-based:

> "Mechanisms do not absolutely dominate the total creation; the universe of universes in toto is mind planned, mind made, and mind administered." (UB 42:11.2)

If the universe is mind made and mind managed, then the power to heal operates through mind. The Lucifer rebellion altered the natural course of progression on our world, introducing far worse conditions of sickness and suffering than normal worlds experience. From the celestial perspective, much of what we endure was never part of the original plan. It was introduced by a mind in rebellion, and it can be corrected by minds aligned with the Father's will.

> "The mortals of a normal world do not experience constant warfare between their physical and spiritual natures. They are confronted with the necessity of climbing up from the animal levels of existence to the higher planes of spiritual living, but this ascent is more like undergoing an educational training when compared with the intense conflicts of Urantia mortals in this realm of the divergent material and spiritual natures." (UB 34:7.3)

The principle puts healing squarely in the realm of the mind. The UB confirms this. When it explains how healing actually worked during Jesus' ministry, every condition it names is a condition of mind: living faith, spiritual purpose, and the compassion of the Creator Son. Not one condition is physical.

> "We believe that many of these apparent miracles of healing, as they occurred in the course of Jesus' earth ministry, were the result of the coexistence of the following three powerful, potent, and associated influences: the presence of strong, dominant, and living faith in the heart of the human being who persistently sought healing, together with the fact that such healing was desired for its spiritual benefits rather than for purely physical restoration." (UB 149:1.4)

"You are a miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator." This remains literally true. A volitional personality in liaison with an Adjuster becomes creative in the presence of the Supreme. The result is an immortal soul, which is the one creation of light that truly endures.

> "Man, a volitional personality, becomes creative in liaison with an Adjuster, an impersonal entity, in the presence of the finite potentialities of the Supreme, and the result is the flowering of an immortal soul." (UB 117:3.5)

---

## Principle 25

> "Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the Atonement. This process works all the time and in all the dimensions of time." (Tx:1.28)

The Course gives Jesus' own explanation of Atonement: "The purpose of my part in the Atonement is the canceling out of all lacks of love which men could not otherwise correct. The word 'sin' should be changed to 'lack of love' because 'sin' is a man-made word with threat connotations which he made up himself."

This is the eternal view of sin. The UB tells us God has already forgiven us before we ask. Spirit beings consider the material world almost entirely unreal. From that perspective, sin is not a crime to be punished but a lack to be filled. Each miracle fills a lack. Each act of forgiveness adds a link to the chain. When the chain is complete, that is the Atonement: all lacks of love corrected, the Sonship restored, the Supreme complete.
