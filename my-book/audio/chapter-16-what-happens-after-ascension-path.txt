Chapter 16. What Happens After - The Ascension Path.


Section 1: Opening, Where the Course Leaves Off.

The Course in Miracles is intensely focused on the present. It teaches us to choose again, to forgive now, to accept the Atonement today. It speaks of awakening, of returning to knowledge, of remembering what we never really forgot.

But what happens after?

The Course hints at continuation without detail. It speaks of the journey's end, of returning to God, of recognizing our place in the Sonship. Yet it provides no map of what lies beyond death, no description of the worlds to come, no account of the long path to Paradise.

The Urantia Book provides that map.

Where the Course focuses on the transformation of mind required for eternal survival, the Urantia Book describes what that survival actually looks like, the worlds we will inhabit, the transitions we will undergo, the beings we will become. The Course prepares us for the journey. The Urantia Book shows us the road.


Section 2: The Goal, Fusion.

The Course in Miracles is a course in Adjuster fusion. This is its purpose, its method, its destination. The mind training it provides, the surrender of ego, the practice of forgiveness, the transfer of identity from the material to the spiritual, these are the steps toward fusion with the indwelling divine fragment.

Fusion can happen here, on this world, in this life.

Jesus demonstrated this. At his baptism, the Urantia Book records that he had achieved such complete harmony with his Adjuster that fusion could have occurred. He had transferred his identity from the human to the divine. He had completed the course.

This is what the Course offers us: the same achievement Jesus demonstrated. Not after death. Not on some distant training world. Here. Now. The miracle principles, the forgiveness practice, the constant choosing again, these are fusion training.

Those who complete the process while in the flesh may bypass some or all of the mansion world curriculum. They have already done the work. They wake up further along the path.


Section 3: The Mansion Worlds, Completing What Remains.

Most of us will not achieve fusion in this life. The rebellion-scarred conditions of our world, our biological inheritance, the shortness of mortal life, these make complete fusion rare here. But the Course moves us toward it. Every lesson learned, every forgiveness offered, every moment of choosing the Adjuster over the ego, these count.

For those who die before fusion, the mansion worlds exist to complete the process.

The Urantia Book describes seven mansion worlds, training spheres where surviving mortals continue the work they began on Earth. This is not generic afterlife. This is fusion school. The same curriculum the Course provides continues there, with visible teachers and tangible progress, until the mortal will and the divine will become permanently one.

How far along you arrive depends on how far along you were when you left. A mortal who practiced the Course faithfully, who learned forgiveness, who surrendered the ego, this mortal wakes up advanced, perhaps bypassing early mansion worlds entirely. The work done here transfers directly.

The mansion worlds are not punishment or delay. They are mercy, the opportunity to complete what mortal life could not complete. But they are not the goal. Fusion is the goal. The Course offers it here. The mansion worlds offer it to those who need more time.


Section 4: Jesus, The Pattern of Progression.

If we want to see what progression toward fusion looks like in a human life, we need only study Jesus.

The Urantia Book provides unprecedented detail about Jesus' inner life, his childhood questions, his adolescent struggles, his gradual attainment of complete harmony with the Father's will. This was not instantaneous enlightenment but progressive achievement. Year by year, choice by choice, Jesus aligned his human will with the divine will until the two became one.

At his baptism in the Jordan, this process reached its culmination. The Urantia Book records that Jesus had achieved such complete synchrony with his Adjuster that fusion could have occurred, the permanent union of human identity with divine spirit. He chose to defer this fusion to continue his ministry in the flesh, but the achievement was complete.

This is what the Course is teaching us to do. When it speaks of accepting the Atonement, of surrendering the ego, of choosing love over fear, it is describing the same process Jesus demonstrated. His life is the curriculum made visible. The Urantia Book promises:

"His brothers in the flesh of mortal life can follow him along this same experience of Father discovery." from the Urantia Book, Paper 101

We will not achieve what Jesus achieved in a single lifetime. Our biological inheritance, our rebellion-scarred world, our confused egos, all these slow our progress. But the path is the same. The destination is the same. And the one who walked it perfectly now guides us through the Course he dictated.


Section 5: Fusion, Milestone, Not Destination.

Fusion is the goal of the Course. But fusion is not the end of the journey.

When mortal will and divine will become permanently one, whether on Earth or on the mansion worlds, something irreversible happens. The human identity and the Adjuster merge. The mortal becomes immortal. Death is no longer possible. The surviving personality is now eternal.

But eternal life is not static existence. Fusion is a beginning.

The Urantia Book describes the universe as a vast school, with Paradise at its center. Fusion qualifies us to continue ascending, through the local universe, through the superuniverse, through the billion worlds of the central universe, until finally we stand in the presence of the Universal Father on Paradise itself.

This journey takes time beyond our comprehension. Millions of years, perhaps billions. We will inhabit hundreds of different forms, study under thousands of teachers, serve in capacities we cannot now imagine. The fused mortal becomes a finaliter, a completed being of time, ready for eternal service.

The Course does not describe this journey because its focus is on the first step: fusion. But knowing where fusion leads expands our vision. We are not simply escaping the ego. We are becoming citizens of the universe.


Section 6: The Long Path to Paradise.

After fusion, the ascender continues through the local universe, the realm created and administered by a Creator Son. Our Creator Son is Jesus. Having achieved fusion, we enter more fully into his domain, learning the ways of his creation, serving his purposes, growing in capacity.

From the local universe, the journey extends outward to the superuniverse, a vast administrative unit containing millions of local universes. Here the ascender studies under the Ancients of Days, learns the nature of the Trinity, and prepares for the final leg of the journey.

The central universe of Havona contains a billion perfect worlds, each one unique, each one a new curriculum. Here the ascender is perfected, not by struggle but by attainment. The deficiencies of evolutionary origin are transcended. The being that began as an animal-origin mortal becomes indistinguishable from beings created in perfection.

Finally: Paradise. The geographic center of infinity. The dwelling place of the Universal Father. The ascender, once a confused mortal on a quarantined world, stands in the presence of God and is recognized as a son.

This is where the Course leads. Not to escape from the world, but to the center of all worlds. Not to rest, but to eternal service. The Father discovery that Jesus demonstrated, completed and extended across all eternity.


Section 7: Closing, The Path You Are On.

The Course in Miracles tells you what to do. The Urantia Book tells you where it leads.

You are not simply correcting your perception. You are preparing for fusion, the permanent union of your will with the Father's will. You are not simply learning to forgive. You are building the foundation for eternal life. You are not simply studying two books. You are walking the same path Jesus walked. The Urantia Book says:

"His brothers in the flesh of mortal life can follow him along this same experience of Father discovery." from the Urantia Book, Paper 101

This is The Urantia Book's promise. Not that the path is easy, it is not. Not that you will complete it quickly, you will not. But that the path is real, the destination is real, and the one who walked it before you has left a Course to guide you.

Two revelations arrived within fifty years. One provides the map. One provides the training. Together, they offer quarantined mortals everything needed to begin the journey that never ends.

The mansion worlds wait for those who need more time. Paradise waits at the end. But the first step is here, now, in this life, the choice to begin.

You have already begun. You are reading this book. The Adjuster within you brought you here. The path to the Father stretches out before you, and every step you take is counted.

Something new is possible. It always was.
