## Notes

*Space for anything else you want me to know about you, your book, or how to work together.*

> For me this is a theoretical exercise. I have not attained these lofty goals. But first comes theory, then practice. First you need a goal to aim for. I hope this book inspires a community to explore this moon shot — taking humanity to another level of awareness.
