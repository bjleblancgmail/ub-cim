# Chapter 3: A Course in Miracles - The True History

**STATUS: COMPLETE**

---

## Section 1: Opening — A Book With Two Versions

Most readers of A Course in Miracles do not know there are two versions of the book. They read the edition published by the Foundation for Inner Peace — the version found in bookstores, the version studied in groups, the version that has shaped popular understanding of the Course for decades.

But this is not the original.

The original — what we call the urtext or JCIM (Jesus Course in Miracles) — is significantly different. It contains material that was edited out. It provides context that was removed. And in at least one critical respect, it teaches something different about the nature of reality.

Understanding this history matters. For readers seeking to integrate the Course with the Urantia Book, the original version is far more compatible. The edited version removed context that creates unnecessary conflict between the two revelations. The Foundation also promoted a rigid interpretation based on their edited copy, further compounding the conflict.

This chapter tells the story of how the Course came to us — and what was lost along the way.

## Section 2: Helen and Bill — The Original Collaboration

In 1965, Helen Schucman began hearing an inner voice. She was a research psychologist at Columbia University, working alongside her colleague Bill Thetford. Neither was particularly religious. Both were skeptical of mystical experiences.

Yet the voice persisted. It identified itself as Jesus. And it asked Helen to take dictation.

The process that followed lasted seven years. Helen would hear nonverbal communication — ideas impressed upon her mind — and translate them into shorthand notes. The voice did not speak in audible words; Helen had to find the language herself. She was fully conscious throughout, never in trance. The process was laborious, requiring intense concentration.

Each evening, Helen would review her shorthand and transcribe it into longhand. Then Bill would type Helen's handwritten pages. Together they discussed the material, questioned it, and — with the voice's explicit permission — edited it.

This collaboration between Helen, Bill, and Jesus produced what we call the Helen and Bill version, or the urtext. It was completed around 1972.

## Section 3: The Editing Process

The urtext was never intended to be the final draft. Jesus gave Helen and Bill freedom to edit as they thought best. He relied on them to deliver his message in a form that could reach others.

This creates an important distinction. The urtext is not "Jesus' literal words" in the way some imagine. Helen translated nonverbal impressions into language. She and Bill then shaped that language into readable form. The result is Jesus' message filtered through human minds and human decisions.

This is the nature of personal revelation. Unlike the Urantia Book — where a sleeping subject transmitted material without conscious filtering — the Course passed through Helen's vocabulary, her conceptual framework, her editorial judgment. Jesus worked within these limitations rather than overriding them.

The urtext itself contains several layers. It includes much personal information — communications between Jesus, Helen, and Bill about their lives and circumstances — that was never meant to be in the final version. Some editing was always expected.

From this raw material, Helen and Bill produced their final edited version — removing the personal content while preserving the teaching. This Helen and Bill version was given to the Edgar Cayce library at the Association for Research and Enlightenment. It represents their considered judgment about what the Course should contain. This version would prove significant when it was rediscovered years later.

## Section 4: The Second Round of Editing

Helen and Bill finished their edited version and gave a copy to the Edgar Cayce library at the Association for Research and Enlightenment. Bill then disengaged from further editing — his work was done.

But Ken Wapnick convinced Helen that the text needed further editing. Unlike the original collaboration, where Helen and Bill had edited with Jesus's permission and guidance, this new round of editing was Wapnick's initiative — with no direction from Jesus. Helen, by some accounts exhausted and worn down from the years of scribing, went along with the process.

This editing was substantial. Significant portions of the first five chapters were removed, along with edits throughout the text. The introduction was rewritten. Material that connected the Course to broader spiritual concepts was trimmed. The result was a leaner, more focused text — but also a text that had lost important context.

In 1976, the Foundation for Inner Peace published what became the standard edition. This is what most people mean when they say "A Course in Miracles." For decades, it was the only version widely available. The original Helen and Bill version existed outside the control of those preparing the published edition — preserved at the Edgar Cayce library, waiting to be rediscovered.

## Section 5: The Discovery of the Original

In 2000, a copyright lawsuit changed everything.

The Foundation for Inner Peace sued Endeavor Academy for publishing Course material without permission. During the legal proceedings, researchers discovered that Helen's original shorthand notebooks had been deposited in the Library of Congress. The copyright claim required establishing what the original text actually was.

What emerged was the urtext — substantially different from the published version. Material that had been edited out was now available. The editing decisions became visible. Researchers could compare what Jesus had communicated with what had been published.

The lawsuit ultimately resulted in much of the Course entering the public domain. More importantly, it made the original text accessible to anyone who wanted to study it.

## Section 6: JCIM vs ACIM — Why It Matters

In the urtext, Jesus makes a direct statement about the importance of the early chapters:

> "This is a course in mind training. All learning involves attention and study at some level. Some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their study. You will also need them for preparation. Without this, you may become much too fearful when the unexpected does occur to make constructive use of it. However, as you study these earlier sections, you will begin to see some of their implications, which will be amplified considerably later on."

These earlier sections — the very ones Jesus said were necessary for understanding the later parts of the Course — were heavily edited by Ken Wapnick.

This creates a problem. Readers of the Foundation for Inner Peace edition are missing material that Jesus said they would need. Without this preparation, the later teachings can be misunderstood.

One critical example: the published version suggests — in ways the urtext does not — that the ego created material reality. This idea creates an apparent conflict with the Urantia Book, which clearly teaches that God created the material universe through his creative agencies.

The urtext is clearer: the ego did not create the physical world. The ego creates our *perception* of the world — the fearful, separated, conflicted way we experience reality. But the material cosmos itself is God's creation, distorted by our perception, not fabricated by our delusion.

The urtext supports this understanding. The published version, missing the earlier context Jesus said was necessary, obscures it.

## Section 7: Closing — Which Version to Read

This study guide works primarily with the urtext — the Jesus Course in Miracles. When we quote the Course, we quote from this original version unless otherwise noted.

The urtext is available online at jcim.net and other sources. It can be compared line by line with the published edition. Readers who have studied the Foundation for Inner Peace version will find the core teachings familiar, but the additional context illuminating.

For those integrating the Course with the Urantia Book, the urtext is essential. It preserves Jesus' teaching in its fuller form, before editorial decisions removed material that connects the Course to broader cosmological truth.

Helen Schucman spent seven years taking down what she heard. Bill Thetford spent those same years typing, questioning, and collaborating. Together with Jesus, they produced something remarkable — a personal revelation from the Creator Son to a quarantined world.

That original work deserves to be read.
