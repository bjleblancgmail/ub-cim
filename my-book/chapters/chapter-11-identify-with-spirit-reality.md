# Chapter 11: Identify with Spirit Reality

**STATUS: COMPLETE**

## Section 1: Opening — A Course in Mind Training

The Course in Miracles describes itself plainly:

> "This is a course in mind training."

Not a course in theology. Not a course in cosmology. A course in *training the mind* — teaching it to see differently, to choose differently, to identify differently.

The Urantia Book describes the same process without calling it a course:

> "The truly religious individual seeks to identify the self with the universe and then to dedicate the activities of this unified self to the service of the universe family of fellow beings, human and superhuman."

Identify the self with the universe. This is what both books are teaching — a fundamental shift in what you believe yourself to be. Not the body. Not the ego. Not the collection of fears and desires that make up ordinary consciousness. Something larger. Something eternal.

The Course aims to lessen your identification with material reality and strengthen your identification with spirit reality. The Urantia Book describes this as the prerequisite for becoming real:

> "Only as a creature becomes God-identified, does he become truly real in the universes."

You are not yet fully real. You are becoming real. And what makes you real is what you identify with.

## Section 2: What You Identify With

Everyone identifies with something. You cannot escape it. The question is not whether you will identify, but with *what*.

The Course says:

> "Everyone identifies himself with his thought system, and every thought system centers on what you believe you are. If the center of the thought system is true, only truth extends from it. But if a lie is at its center, only deception proceeds from it."

The center of your thought system. What do you believe you are? A body that will die? A social role that can be threatened? A collection of achievements that might be forgotten? Or a child of God, indwelt by a fragment of the eternal, destined for fusion with the divine?

What you believe you are shapes everything else. From that center, your entire experience radiates.

The Urantia Book offers two possibilities:

> "The mortal mind may also fully identify itself with the indwelling spirit Adjuster."

Or, as The Urantia Book warns:

> "The sinner finally identified himself wholly with sin."

Two directions. Identify with the Adjuster — with spirit, with eternal values, with the divine presence within — and you become real. Identify with sin — with selfishness, with separation, with the denial of God — and you become unreal. Eventually, completely unreal.

This is not punishment. It is simply the consequence of identification. What you align with, you become. What you become determines what survives.

## Section 3: The Two Thought Systems

Here is the problem: you are currently living in two thought systems at once.

One thought system is the ego — the material mind, oriented toward the body, concerned with survival, threat, status, acquisition. It sees separation everywhere. It believes you are alone.

The other thought system is spirit — the Adjuster, oriented toward eternity, concerned with truth, beauty, goodness, love. It sees connection everywhere. It knows you are not alone.

The Course is blunt:

> "The way out of conflict between two opposing thought systems is clearly to choose one and relinquish the other. If you identify with your thought system, and you cannot escape this, and if you accept two thought systems which are in complete disagreement, peace of mind is impossible."

Peace of mind is impossible. As long as you try to live in both systems — serving the ego sometimes and the spirit sometimes, believing you are a body sometimes and a soul sometimes — you will experience conflict. The two systems are incompatible. They cannot be reconciled. One must be chosen.

The Urantia Book confirms this:

> "The human mind does not well stand the conflict of double allegiance. It is a severe strain on the soul to undergo the experience of an effort to serve both good and evil. The supremely happy and efficiently unified mind is the one wholly dedicated to the doing of the will of the Father in heaven."

Wholly dedicated. Not partially. Not sometimes. The unified mind — the mind at peace — is the one that has chosen. It has stopped trying to serve two masters. It has identified with spirit and released its grip on the ego.

## Section 4: The Fringe of Conflict

But here is the mercy: the conflict is temporary. It is a transition zone, not a permanent condition.

The Urantia Book names it directly:

> "Forewarn all believers regarding the fringe of conflict which must be traversed by all who pass from the life as it is lived in the flesh to the higher life as it is lived in the spirit. To those who live quite wholly within either realm, there is little conflict or confusion, but all are doomed to experience more or less uncertainty during the times of transition between the two levels of living."

The fringe of conflict. You are passing through it. Everyone who makes this journey passes through it. Those who live "quite wholly" in the material realm — identified entirely with the body, unaware of spirit — experience little conflict because they have not begun the transition. Those who live "quite wholly" in the spiritual realm — the fused beings, the ascended mortals — experience little conflict because they have completed it.

But you are in between. You have begun to awaken. You have glimpsed something beyond the material. And now you experience the tension of two worlds pulling at you.

This is normal. This is expected. This is the price of growth.

The Urantia Book explains why the struggle cannot be avoided:

> "Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised in behalf of the great, the good, the true, and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual vision and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving."

The animal mind rebels. This is what the Course calls the ego's resistance — the part of you that fights the very growth you are seeking.

The Course describes the same territory:

> "You who identify with your egos cannot believe that God loves you."

When you identify with the ego, God's love seems impossible. You feel unworthy, separate, alone. But as identification shifts — as you begin to identify with the spirit within — God's love becomes not only possible but obvious. Of course the Father loves you. You are his child. The Adjuster within you is proof of that love.

## Section 5: The Practice of Re-Identification

How do you shift identification? Not by force. Not by denial. By practice.

The Course workbook is 365 lessons — one for each day of the year — designed to train the mind to see differently. Each lesson is a small step in re-identification. Each day, you practice remembering what you really are.

The Urantia Book describes the same practice through worship and prayer:

> "Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole; the finite with the Infinite; the son with the Father; time in the act of striking step with eternity."

Worship is identification. When you worship, you are not begging a distant God for favors. You are aligning yourself — identifying yourself — with the source of your being. You are remembering your place in the larger reality. You are striking step with eternity.

And prayer, the Urantia Book says:

> "Prayer becomes the great unifier of the various inspirations of the creative imagination and the faith urges of a soul trying to identify itself with the spirit ideals of the indwelling and associated divine presence."

A soul trying to identify itself. That is what you are doing. Every time you pray, every time you practice the Course lessons, every time you choose peace over conflict — you are trying to identify with spirit. And gradually, through practice, the trying becomes being.

## Section 6: Liberation from Time

Something remarkable happens as identification shifts: time loosens its grip.

The Urantia Book says:

> "Spiritual volition has begun to taste liberation from the fetters of time, having achieved partial escape from time sequence, and that is because spiritual volition is self-identifying with the will of God."

Liberation from the fetters of time. This is not metaphor. As you identify with spirit, you begin to experience time differently. The anxious urgency of the ego — always rushing, always worried about the future — begins to fade. The eternal present becomes more accessible. You taste, even now, the timelessness that will be fully yours after fusion.

The Course speaks of the same release:

> "When you imprison yourself, you are losing sight of your true identification with me and with the Father. Your identification is with the Father and with the Son. It cannot be with one and not the other."

Your identification is with the Father and with the Son. When you remember this — when you identify with it — the prison doors open. The fears that seemed so solid become insubstantial. The time pressure that drove you relaxes. You are eternal. What is there to rush toward?

## Section 7: Closing — The Choice That Ends Conflict

The conflict of two thought systems is real. You are experiencing it. But it is not permanent.

The Course says you must choose one and relinquish the other. The Urantia Book says the supremely happy mind is wholly dedicated to the Father's will. Both are saying the same thing: peace comes through decision.

You do not have to make this decision all at once. You do not have to be perfect. You only have to keep choosing — moment by moment, day by day — to identify with spirit rather than ego, with the Adjuster rather than the fears of the material mind.

Each choice strengthens the identification. Each practice deepens the commitment. Each moment of peace expands the territory of the eternal within you.

The fringe of conflict is real, but it is also passing. You are moving through it. On the other side is a mind unified, at peace, wholly dedicated to the will of the Father — and therefore supremely happy.

Keep practicing. Keep choosing. The unified mind is not far away. It is being built within you, one identification at a time.
