    <h3>CURRENT</h3>
    <p>The Course in Miracles never uses this language. It speaks instead of miracles, of atonement, of the union of Father and Son. But it is teaching the same thing. A Course in Miracles says:</p>
    <blockquote>"The miracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between Father and son."</blockquote>
    <p>This is not metaphor. This is the Course describing, in its own vocabulary, exactly what the Urantia Book calls Adjuster fusion.</p>

    <h3>PROPOSED</h3>
    <p>The Course in Miracles never uses the term "Adjuster fusion." But it uses the word <em>fusion</em> itself. A Course in Miracles says:</p>
    <blockquote>"The miracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between Father and son." (JCIM, Chapter 5)</blockquote>
    <p><span class="new-text">This is not an isolated line. The Course returns to this language:</span></p>
    <blockquote><span class="new-text">"Alone we can do nothing, but together our wills fuse into something whose power is far beyond the power of its separate parts. By not being separate, the Will of God is established in ours and as ours." (JCIM, Chapter 7)</span></blockquote>
    <p><span class="new-text">And again:</span></p>
    <blockquote><span class="new-text">"Seeing WITH Him will SHOW you that all meaning, INCLUDING YOURS, comes not from double vision, but from the gentle fusing of everything into one meaning, one emotion and one purpose." (JCIM, Chapter 14)</span></blockquote>
    <p><span class="new-text">Three times the Course uses the word "fuse" or "fusing." Three times it describes the union of human will with divine will. This is not metaphor. This is the Course describing, in its own vocabulary, exactly what the Urantia Book calls Adjuster fusion.</span></p>
    <p>The chapters that follow will trace this connection in detail — the bridge, the transfer, the spark, the path. But the thesis is simple: these two books describe the same journey. One provides the map. The other teaches the walking.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <strong>What changed:</strong> The opening no longer rests on a single quote. It now presents three Course passages using the word "fuse" or "fusing," establishing a pattern rather than a one-off. This is the single most important upgrade in the book. The central thesis chapter now has three pieces of Course evidence instead of one.
</div>

<h3 style="margin-top:20px; color:#555;">Change B: Section 4 (Transfer of Identity) — after line 91</h3>

<div class="comparison">
  <div class="side current">
    <h3>CURRENT (lines 89-93)</h3>
    <p>The Course does not speak of the material body and the morontia soul. It speaks of perception and knowledge, of the ego and the spirit, of fear and love. But the movement is identical: you must shift your identity from what is passing away to what is eternal.</p>
    <p>This is the work. Every lesson in the Course workbook, every moment of forgiveness, every release of judgment — all of it serves the transfer. You are learning to identify with spirit rather than ego, with the eternal rather than the temporal, with the Adjuster rather than the animal mind.</p>
    <p>The transfer does not happen all at once. It is progressive. The Urantia Book describes it as a gradual building of the soul. The Course describes it as a gradual awakening from a dream. Both are describing a journey that takes a lifetime — or longer. It is a required course.</p>

    <p><span class="new-text">He wills you Himself. The Father's gift of the Adjuster is precisely this: He gives you a piece of Himself. And you will yourself to Him. The transfer is bilateral. Both wills move toward union. Both reach the same place: one will.</span></p>

<div class="explanation">
  <strong>What changed:</strong> Added Quote #4 to Section 4. "He wills you HIMSELF" parallels the Adjuster gift — the Father literally gives Himself to you. The interpretive bridge connects this to the bilateral nature of fusion: you move toward God, God moves toward you. Both arrive at one will.

    <p><span class="new-text">His gratitude to you for His completion. God is not merely waiting for you to arrive. Your completion completes Him. The Supreme needs your growth the way a body needs every cell. This is not humility dressed as theology.

<div class="explanation">
  <strong>What changed:</strong> Replaced the generic "The Course teaches the same" sentence with Quote #9 and a three-sentence interpretive bridge. The mutual completion idea — your growth completes God — is one of the strongest Sonship/Supreme parallels in the entire Course. It transforms this section from "the Course agrees" to "the Course says something stunning."

    <p><span class="new-text">The Course teaches that you can create an empty shell, but you cannot create nothing at all. You can refuse to fill yourself with what is real, but you cannot unmake yourself. The Urantia Book speaks from both the eternal and the temporal perspectives. From eternity, personality is changeless and will attain deity destiny. But from within time, the stakes are real. An identity wholly identified with iniquity "becomes as though it had never been." The personality endures, absorbed into the Supreme. The Adjuster returns to the Father, carrying forward everything of spiritual value from that life. What is lost is only the identity that chose to identify with what has no reality. The Course sees from the side where nothing real is at risk. The Urantia Book sees from both sides, and warns that what you build with your choices matters. Both ask the same question: will you identify with what is real?</span></p>

<div class="explanation">
  <strong>What changed:</strong> Added Quote #11 with a balanced interpretive bridge. The Course speaks from eternity (your nature is already God's will). The UB speaks from time (you must choose to align with that nature, and survival depends on it). Both perspectives honored. Neither collapsed into the other.

    <p><span class="new-text">The forgiveness of mercy separates. It keeps the divide between the one who pardons and the one who is pardoned. The forgiveness of love unites. It sees no divide to begin with. And the will to unite must be unequivocal — not partial, not conditional, not "I forgive you but I remember." Total. Whole. This is the same wholeness both books describe as fusion: the will no longer divided, no longer split between ego and spirit, but wholly given to love.</span></p>

  <strong>What changed:</strong> Added Quote #6 to the closing, connecting forgiveness to the fusion thesis. The forgiveness of mercy separates (keeps the divide). The forgiveness of love unites.
