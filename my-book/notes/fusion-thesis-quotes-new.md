# New Fusion-Thesis Quotes

**Date found:** 2026-02-14
**Purpose:** Course/urtext passages supporting "the Course is a course in Adjuster fusion," beyond Tx 5.18. None of these are currently used in the book.

---

## Tier 1: Strongest (explicit fusion/union language)

**1.** "Alone we can do nothing, but together our wills **fuse** into something whose power is far beyond the power of its separate parts. By not being separate, the Will of God is established in ours and as ours."
*(Urtext Ch 7)* — Second explicit use of "fuse" in the Course. Will-fusion stated directly.

**2.** "Seeing WITH Him will SHOW you that all meaning, INCLUDING YOURS, comes not from double vision, but from the gentle **fusing** of everything into one meaning, one emotion and one purpose."
*(Urtext Ch 14)* — Third use of fusion language. Double vision (ego/spirit split) replaced by fused unity.

**3.** "As you cross to JOIN it, IT will JOIN WITH YOU, and BECOME ONE with you. And you will think, in glad astonishment, that for all this, YOU GAVE UP NOTHING!"
*(Urtext Ch 16)* — Bilateral fusion: you move toward divine, divine moves toward you. Parallels the Adjuster meeting the creature halfway.

**4.** "To unite having and being is only to unite your will with His, for He wills you HIMSELF. And you will yourself to HIM, because in your perfect understanding of Him, you KNOW there IS but One Will."
*(Urtext Ch 8)* — "He wills you HIMSELF" parallels the Adjuster gift. "One Will" is the fused state.

**5.** "Oh come ye faithful, to the holy union of the Father and Son in YOU!"
*(Urtext Ch 19)* — Union of Father and Son occurs IN the individual. Fusion as internal event.

## Tier 2: Strong (mechanism of fusion)

**6.** "Separation is overcome by union. It CANNOT be overcome by separating. The will to unite must be unequivocal, or the will itself is separated or NOT WHOLE."
*(Urtext Ch 8)* — The mechanism stated plainly: separation overcome by union, will must be total.

**7.** "God ASKS you do your will. He joins with YOU... who has made you co-creator of the universe along with Him."
*(Urtext, May 23 1968)* — God joins with you. Made co-creator. Dense fusion passage.

**8.** "The Spirit of God's Son shines in the Mind of the Father, and becomes one with it. Very gently does God shine upon Himself, loving the extension of Himself which is His Son."
*(Urtext Ch 11)* — Two becoming one. Fusion described as divine self-recognition.

**9.** "Completing Him by your completion." / "In YOUR completion lies the memory of HIS wholeness, and His gratitude to you for His completion."
*(Urtext Ch 16)* — Mutual completion: you complete God, God completes you. Parallels UB's teaching that the Adjuster needs the creature for personality expression.

**10.** "God Himself can flow across the little gap."
*(Urtext Ch 5)* — When perception is purified enough, God flows into you. The "last step."

## Tier 3: Supporting (identity, will-oneness, indwelling)

**11.** "You are the Will of God... your identification with His Will is not optional because it is what you are."
*(Urtext Ch 7)* — Identity IS God's will. Fusion is recognition, not achievement.

**12.** "The lesson is that your will and God's CANNOT be out of accord because they ARE one. This is the UNdoing of everything the ego tries to teach."
*(Urtext Ch 7)* — Will-oneness as ontological fact.

**13.** "NOT doing the will of God IS a lack of self."
*(Urtext early material)* — Alienation from God's will = diminishment of self.

**14.** "LET yourself be ONE with something beyond the body... GAINING, NOT losing, a sense of self... a quiet melting in."
*(Urtext Nov 1966)* — Fusion as expansion, not annihilation. "Quiet melting in" is the experiential quality.

**15.** "Salvation is right-mindedness which is NOT the one-mindedness of the Soul, but which must be accomplished before one-mindedness can be restored."
*(Urtext Ch 4)* — Two stages: right-mindedness (process) vs. one-mindedness (fusion destination).

**16.** "God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it, thus establishing it forever as a channel for the reception of His Mind and Will."
*(Urtext Ch 5)* — God placed His mind within yours at creation. The indwelling mechanism.

**17.** "When the will of the Sonship and the Father are one, their perfect accord IS Heaven."
*(Urtext Ch 1)* — Heaven defined as the state of will-fusion.

**18.** "Your ego and your Soul will never be co-creators, but your Soul and YOUR Creator will ALWAYS be."
*(Urtext Ch 4)* — Only the Soul (Adjuster) can partner with God. The ego cannot fuse.

**19.** "The miracle-worker accepts the time-control factor gladly, because he knows that every collapse of time brings all men closer to the ultimate RELEASE from time, in which the Son and the Father ARE one."
*(Urtext Ch 1)* — Every miracle moves humanity toward Father-Son oneness.

**20.** "There is a place in you where this whole world has been forgotten, where no memory of sin and of illusion lingers still... your Identity abides in Them, and where They are, forever must you be."
*(CIM-OE 31)* — Describes the indwelling Adjuster: beyond time, where your Identity abides.

## Notes

- The Course uses "fuse" or "fusing" at least **three** times: Tx 5.18 (already in book), Ch 7 (#1 above), and Ch 14 (#2 above).
- Quotes #1-5 are strong enough to anchor chapters on their own.
- Several quotes cluster around Urtext Ch 7-8, suggesting those chapters are particularly rich for the fusion thesis.
- Quote #9 (mutual completion) is especially powerful for the UB parallel: the Adjuster needs the creature just as the creature needs the Adjuster.
