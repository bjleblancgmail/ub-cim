## Water to Wine — Abrogation of Time

**Source:** UB Paper 137, Section 4 (The Wedding at Cana)

> "But this was in no sense a miracle. No law of nature was modified, abrogated, or even transcended. Nothing happened but the abrogation of time in association with the celestial assembly of the chemical elements requisite for the elaboration of the wine."

**Possible use:** Chapter 9 (Miracles and Time), Section 2 — pairs with the existing food multiplication quote. Two examples of the same mechanism: time eliminated, not natural law broken.

## The Seven Circles — From Animal Mind to Morontia

**Source:** UB 110:6.21

> "The seven circles embrace mortal experience extending from the highest purely animal level to the lowest actual contactual morontia level of self-consciousness as a personality experience. The mastery of the first cosmic circle signalizes the attainment of premorontia mortal maturity and marks the termination of the conjoint ministry of the adjutant mind-spirits as an exclusive influence of mind action in the human personality. Beyond the first circle, mind becomes increasingly akin to the intelligence of the morontia stage of evolution, the conjoined ministry of the cosmic mind and the superadjutant endowment of the Creative Spirit of a local universe."

**Possible use:**
- **Chapter 13 (Perception vs Knowledge), Section 4** — already discusses the seven adjutants and the circles of attainment. This quote expands on it: the circles ARE the journey from perception to knowledge. Mastering the first circle = adjutant mind no longer dominates = the Course's shift from perception to knowledge is complete.
- **Chapter 11 (Identify with Spirit Reality)** — supports the "fringe of conflict" discussion. You're moving through the circles, and the conflict lessens as adjutant influence diminishes.
- **Chapter 10 (Adjuster Fusion)** — could illustrate what the "transfer" looks like in UB terms: moving through circles until morontia mind takes over.

## Religious Perplexities — The Struggle Is Required

**Source:** UB 100:4.2

> "Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised in behalf of the great, the good, the true, and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual vision and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving."

**Possible use:**
- **Chapter 11 (Identify with Spirit Reality), Section 4** — "The Fringe of Conflict." This quote IS the fringe of conflict explained from the UB side. The mind protests being weaned from material identification. The "slothful animal mind rebels" — this is what the Course calls the ego's resistance. Perfect parallel.
- **Chapter 14 (Fear vs Love)** — supports the idea that fear/conflict during spiritual growth is normal, not a sign of failure. The struggle is the curriculum.
- **Chapter 8 (What is Real), Section 5** — "What Makes You Unreal." The animal mind clinging to temporal existence is identification with the unreal.
