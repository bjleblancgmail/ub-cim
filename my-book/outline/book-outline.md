# UB-CIM Study Guide Outline

**Working Title:** TBD (perhaps "The Path to the Final Father" or "Two Revelations, One Path")

**Core Thesis:** The Course in Miracles is a course in Adjuster fusion, presented from the eternal spirit perspective by Jesus. The UB provides the cosmological framework; the CIM provides the practical path.

**Purpose:** A study guide synthesizing The Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles for readers of either or both texts.

**Audiences:**
1. UB readers wanting to understand CIM
2. CIM readers wanting to understand UB
3. Readers of both seeking deeper synthesis

**Important Distinction:** This study guide works primarily with **JCIM** (Jesus Course in Miracles - the original urtext/notes) rather than **ACIM** (Foundation for Inner Peace's heavily edited version). The urtext is far more compatible with the UB.

## Part 1: Why These Two Books

### Chapter 1: Introduction
- Jesus preparing us for a revival
- Two revelations in 50 years (UB 1955, CIM 1973)
- The author's 40-year journey with both texts
- What this study guide offers
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (opening section)

### Chapter 2: The Urantia Book - An Overview
- The four parts (Cosmology, Local Universe, History of Urantia, Life of Jesus)
- How it was transmitted (celestial authors, contact commission)
- Jesus approved but did not write it - epochal revelation
- Key themes relevant to CIM study

### Chapter 3: A Course in Miracles - The True History
- Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford's original work (7 years of note-taking)
- Helen's shorthand → handwritten transcription → Bill's typed edit
- The Bill Thetford version (given to Edgar Cayce library)
- Ken Wapnick's further editing with Helen "asleep on the sofa"
- The 2001 Endeavor Academy lawsuit and discovery of notes in Library of Congress
- JCIM vs ACIM: Why this distinction matters
- The critical error introduced: "ego created all material reality" (NOT in urtext)
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Timeline, Notes Discovery, Critical Information sections)

### Chapter 4: Epochal vs Personal Revelation
- UB as epochal revelation (word from revelators, no conscious mind filter)
- CIM as personal revelation (filtered through Helen's mind and vocabulary)
- Why Jesus works through scribes, never writes directly (to avoid dogmatization)
- Helen did not know the UB - Jesus stayed within her Christian vocabulary
- The task of mapping concepts across different language
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Personal Revelation section)

### Chapter 5: The Terminology Bridge
- Core mapping table:
  - Sonship ↔ God the Supreme
  - Soul ↔ Thought Adjuster
  - Knowledge ↔ Eternal Perspective
  - Perception ↔ Temporal/Animal Mind
  - Holy Spirit ↔ Spirit of Truth / Superconscious
  - Atonement ↔ Plan of Ascension
- Why these mappings matter
- Cautions about over-simplification
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf, PerceptionVsKnowledge.docx

## Part 2: Thematic Deep Dives

### Chapter 6: The Central Thesis - A Course in Adjuster Fusion
- CIM as the practical path to fusion
- UB provides the map, CIM provides the method
- What Jesus learned in the flesh, taught in the Course
- The "required course" - fusion is the goal
- "The miracle itself is just this fusion or union of will between father and son"
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Adjuster Fusion section), RevivalCIMUBOffical.docx (Chapter 1 analysis)

### Chapter 7: The Sonship / God the Supreme
- CIM: "The Sonship is the sum of all souls God created"
- UB: "The Supreme is the sum total of all finite growth"
- "The Supreme is the synthetic cumulative total"
- We will all simultaneously discover God the Supreme together
- "The Supreme is your universe home, and when you find him, it will be like returning home"
- "Listen and see if you remember an ancient song you knew so long ago"
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (God the Supreme = Sonship section) - 4 detailed comparisons with quotes

### Chapter 8: What is Real? The Eternal Perspective
- To spirit, the material world seems unreal; to material eyes, spirit seems unreal
- We only become real as we identify with eternal realities
- "Such a sin-identified mortal would then become wholly unspiritual in nature (and therefore personally unreal)"
- "The natural as the unreal and fleeting shadow of spirit realities"
- The spiritual eye vs the physical eye
- "Conceptual frames of the universe are only relatively true; they are serviceable scaffolding"
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Unreal vs Real section) - extensive quote comparisons

### Chapter 9: Miracles and Time
- "Miracles shorten time" (both books use this exact language)
- "The elimination of time" in connection with Jesus's ministry
- Jesus had to remain "constantly time conscious" to prevent time miracles
- The 50 miracle principles with UB parallels
- "Miracles therefore rest on the laws of eternity, not of time"
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Time and Miracles section), RevivalCIMUBOffical.docx (detailed miracle principles)

### Chapter 10: Adjuster Fusion - Transfer and the Bridge
- "Transfer of the seat of identity" from material body to morontia soul
- "The Holy Spirit is the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge"
- "Perception can be transferred to knowledge... the last step is taken by God"
- Jesus: "I am the living BRIDGE from one world to another"
- "The bridge that He would carry you across lifts you from time into eternity"
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Adjuster Fusion section) - transfer, fusion, bridge quotes

### Chapter 11: Identify with Spirit Reality
- CIM as mind training: lessen focus on material, strengthen focus on spirit
- The Adjuster at the center of our thought system
- Do we identify with the Ego or the indwelling Adjuster?
- "Only as a creature becomes God-identified, does he become truly real"
- Living in two thought systems creates conflict
- "The fringe of conflict which must be traversed by all who pass from the life as it is lived in the flesh"
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Identify with Spirit Reality section)

### Chapter 12: Forgiveness - Mercy vs Love
- The forgiveness of mercy: "retain the proof he is not really innocent"
- The forgiveness of love: "holds not the proof of sin before his brother's eyes"
- "Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them"
- "The forgiveness of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy"
- "Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin"
- **SOURCE:** UrantiaCourseStory.pdf (Forgiveness section), RevivalCIMUBOffical.docx

### Chapter 13: Perception vs Knowledge
- Two incompatible thought systems
- Perception = animal mind / seven adjutants / ego
- Knowledge = eternal perspective / superconscious
- The Holy Spirit bridges them: "the bridge or thought-transfer of perception to knowledge"
- "When the Holy Spirit has at last led you to Christ... perception fuses into knowledge"
- Cannot be communicated directly - must be experienced
- **SOURCE:** PerceptionVsKnowledge.docx

### Chapter 14: Fear vs Love
- "The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite"
- UB: "Unreasoned fear is a master intellectual fraud practiced upon the evolving mortal soul"
- The Lucifer rebellion as source of fear
- "The philosophical elimination of religious fear"
- Why the Course warns against strain (avoiding mystical states)
- The Course's careful approach vs dangerous mystical practices
- **SOURCE:** course2.docx, stream of thought.docx

### Chapter 15: The Lucifer Rebellion and Why We Suffer
- CIM's oblique references ("darkness and death")
- UB's detailed account
- "Lucifer launched his orgy of darkness and death"
- How rebellion created our confused planet
- The isolation and its purpose
- Why we are held accountable for others' choices (the eternal perspective, the Sonship as one)

### Chapter 16: What Happens After - The Ascension Path
- Where CIM leaves off, UB picks up
- Mansion world training
- The morontia transition
- The long journey to Paradise
- Fusion as milestone, not destination
- "His brothers in the flesh of mortal life can follow him along this same experience of Father discovery"
