\par\plain {\f0\fs26 When I wake up in the morning with all my faculties and body parts intact, I consider it a miracle, especially if I can remember what I did yesterday and what I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m supposed to do today.  Definitely a miracle for me, which makes me exceedingly grateful. I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but many seemingly insignificant things are, to me, small miracles of truth, beauty and goodness . . . little flashes of light.  I  do think each person has their own definition of the miraculous, that which makes them feel connected to the transcendental level of reality . . .  the stuff that amazes them enough to cause wonder and inspire the heart to give thanks.}
