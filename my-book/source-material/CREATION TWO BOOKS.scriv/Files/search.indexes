            <Text>Introduction



More insights than we will unpack in several generations. 

This book will compare conceptual models presented in the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was first published in 1972 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. However, we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition or the Hugh Lynn Casey edition. Both the Urantia Book and a Course in Miracles have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. At first glance the two seem to embrace incompatible conceptual models. A deeper look will reveal surprising consistency.
In the beginning of the 19th century Jesus (Michael) approved of a plan to provide us with an expanded revelation of our Heavenly Father in the form of a book. The Urantia Book was written by a wide variety of celestial beings with varied origins and backgrounds. It claims no human authorship.  Neither did Jesus personally author any of the papers in the Urantia book. Instead, Jesus let his celestial family give their testimony.
In 1972 Jesus (Michael) began a collaboration with Helen Schumann and Bill Thetford on the Course in Miracles. He related lessons learned during his life in the flesh to Bill and Helen. While he did collaborate on the Course in Miracles with Helen, he gave them freedom to edit it as they thought best. Jesus relied on Helen and Bill to deliver his message.
In both the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles Jesus used the same approach of letting his family do the talking. According to the Urantia book Jesus left no writings behind during his life in the flesh. He knew there was a danger of men turning his words into crystallized dogma. So he left the responsibility to deliver his message to his apostles. We know from the Urantia book that that decision had limited success. The apostles did their best to relate his message to the masses. But even this limited success was preferable to Jesus. So in the same way Jesus let various celestial beings relate universal truth to us. Nothing in the UB was written by Jesus directly. Quotes were given of his spoken words only. He took the same approach in the CIM. He communicated to Helen and Bill and let them write, edit, and print their communications to us. He could have magically made a CIM appear in finished form with no human intervention. But he chose to continue his previous decision to be one step removed from any written word. 

Spirit reality is simply beyond description. 


Terminology 
Communication can be challenging. The meaning of a word can be perceived differently for many. Culture, environment, and genetics can have an influence on how we interpret meaning. The Bible is a good historical example of how people interpret words in a book to form different ideas. Consider the number of religions formed as a result of the Bible. Some religions claim to be the only real religion. How can so many people read the same words and form different opinions? Perception varies for each individual. Each person forms his/her own model of reality and adjusts it to every other model. No two are exactly alike. 

The terminology used in these two books differ significantly. Words can convey multiple meanings. This has been a major obstacle in comparing these two book. Both books point out the limitations of language. 

Course in Miracles OE: Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality.

Urantia Book: 0:12.13 We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of our assignment; we recognize the impossibility of fully translating the language of the concepts of divinity and eternity into the symbols of the language of the finite concepts of the mortal mind. 

The Course takes a more abstract approach in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond description, you can only “know” as a result of religious experience. The Urantia book uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the terms perception and knowledge to designate between temporal and eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal (UB:adjutant) mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe multiple points of view including material and spiritual. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the “divine monitor”, “thought adjuster”, “father fragment”, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term “soul”. The way the CIM uses the term is identical to the UB use of “divine monitor”, “thought adjuster”, “father fragment”. In this way the two books use different symantics to relate similar concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly. Each book enhances and expands the other. 

Community

We need a community of spiritual regenerators. People who focus totally on spiritual regeneration. This will uplift all people and ultimately lift the nations. The UB says when x number of young people pursue purely material professions, society cannot survive. 


This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this effort will open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  

There is no question that the two books were created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how the two books have so much in common. The study of the two books complementary nature is a rewarding journey and endless discovery. 

This study will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. 
Jesus lived his life in the flesh and created a path to our heavenly father that we can follow. He gave us the Urantia book revelation to expand our awareness of our existence. It describes in detail our ascension potential. It describes a process called adjuster fusion that will one day be a common occurrence as an alternative to death. He gave us the Course in Miracles to help us achieve this goal and usher in a new age of expanding awareness. 

100:4.2 Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised in behalf of the great, the good, the true, and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual VISION and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving.

A Peek Beyond The Veil

Many of us know from personal experience that something profound exists apart from our material world. Something we call spirit, God, infinity, eternity, and many other labels that tease our logical minds with mystery and wonder. 
We are experiencing a tug of war within ourselves. Seek and ye shall find may be true in our experience of spirit but we still struggle to translate that experience into language that we can all agree on. This disunity of thought is evident by the number of religions created to explain the mystery of our existence. 
Metaphysics has attempted to unify this gap between the temporal world and the spirit world. But is it possible to reverse engineer our reality from the bottom up? Mota is the UB bridge between science and religion. 

UB: 103:6.7 Mota is a superphilosophical reconciliation of divergent reality perception which is nonattainable by material personalities; it is predicated, in part, on the experience of having survived the material life of the flesh. But many mortals have recognized the desirability of having some method of reconciling the interplay between the widely separated domains of science and religion; and metaphysics is the result of man's unavailing attempt to span this well-recognized chasm. But human metaphysics has proved more confusing than illuminating. Metaphysics stands for man's well-meant but futile effort to compensate for the absence of the mota of morontia.

The Urantia book says it is necessary from time to time to provide enhanced revelation to help us move past blocks we would never otherwise move past. We seem to reach a point of diminishing returns as time passes. Overmuch revelation stifles the imagination. Our growth seems to be more important than having our problems solved for us from above. It says overmuch revelation is harmful. 
 What purpose does this life serve? Why were we created. Why is spirit so mysterious? How do we gain access to this world of the spirit?  What is the grand plan of  creation? Peace seems boring in a world of excitement and riches. We can push the boundaries of our mind by making peace of mind a goal.
Access to intuition




Jesus knew something we still do not know. He knew the master plan. Our world was created to fulfill a purpose.

            <Title>Two Books - Revelation</Title>
            <Text>Two Books
Revelation 

Just as we have to build a mental bridge to spirit, we can build a bridge between the Urantia Book and a Course in Miracles. Each one provides clarity to the other. Together they are more powerful than apart. 

We have reached a point of diminishing returns in our attempts to push the boundaries of reality through metaphysics. We are at a dead end. The universe is filled with personalities. The spirit world is reaching out as we cross a tipping point in our history.

Auto Revelation versus direct epochal revelation?
We should take advantage of the insights within these two revelations to adjust our approach to spirit as a scientist would apply the scientific process to a purely material venture. Unlike a science experiment, the results of our trials will be more of a qualitative measure. Love cannot be measured but we do experience it in degrees as we move through life. Sincerity is critical if we intend to relate experience to each other. Only personal religious experience will validate the approach these two books take.  UB? Says theology is the psychology of religion. UB defines religion as personal experience, not necessarily today’s organized religion. 
These two books give us a major conceptual upgrade from our current world model. We are told of details that might have taken us thousands of years to discover. We need to use these insights to build a mental model of the world and how we fit into it. One that parallels spirit as closely as possible. The Course in Miracles tells us we have upside down thinking. We are identified too closely to our material ego minds. Had we not veered from the master plan of creation we would have visible celestial leadership to help us progress towards a right side up way of thinking that deemphasizes the ego mind and emphasizes spirit identification. 

These two books introduce quite a bit of complexity that this author can only touch on. In truth, very little of this complexity needs to be understood to press forward and have genuine religious experiences. As the UB says, ones theology may be very inaccurate, yet his religion is true and genuine. We may attach our real and genuine experiences to inaccurate or partial claims of truth, but the experience itself is personal and true and beyond words.  
Forgiveness 
All of our potential of religious experience is blocked by our unwillingness to forgive and assist our human and divine family. Some of us lack motivation to serve others. One reason for all of this complexity within these books is to give purpose and insight to our decision to forgive our human family and attempt to fill the void of gods love in ourselves and each other. An understanding of who we are and our true purpose in this life is helpful to work on removing the blocks in our mind to the higher mind functions built into our being. These two books promise a future beyond our wildest imaginations. An eternal adventure in time and eternity. 

Gives an expanded view of creation, the trinity, 
A top down perspective as well as a bottom up perspective. 
Just as the Jews did not recognize Jesus as a revelation of God, so it is possible the current revelations may be rejected and attacked. Will pride in an established theology evoke a similar response to the revelation of Jesus?
The Course gives most of its attention to our abilities as concerns our practical application of mind, body, and spirit. In this arena the course expands on information given in the Urantia book. For instance, the Urantia book gives a detailed breakdown of where the Holy Spirit fits into the whole of creation. Whereas the Course in Miracles explains how the Holy Spirit works within our being. We are informed of it’s logic, it’s way of “thinking”. It never attacks, never

            <Text>Our World in Quarantine 

We are a world in quarantine from the Universe. Our history is filled with mythology of spiritual warfare. Mighty plans were made when time began for a perfect order of universe administration. But free will has a place in this mighty creation.  The celestial rulers have to make room for free will to express itself even if it strays from the divine plan. Apparently the universe has benefited from this miscarriage of the divine plan in that free will creatures learn from mistakes made by rebellious personalities. While we think of this orgy of death and destruction as unacceptable from the temporal perspective, the powers that be have a totally different perspective from the eternal perspective. The UB tells us that nothing of survival value is ever lost in all the wide universe.

A Course in Miracles—Original Edition—Text
FIVE—Healing and Wholeness
VI. Therapy and Teaching
Tx:5.47	The Atonement is the guarantee of the safety of the Kingdom. Nothing good is lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice for creation. Nothing that is not good was ever created and therefore cannot be protected. What the ego makes, it keeps to itself, and so it is without strength. Its unshared existence does not die; it was merely never born. Real birth is not a beginning; it is a continuing. Everything that can continue has been born, but it can increase as you are willing to return the part of your mind that needs healing to the higher part and thus render your creating undivided.


Urantia Book: 109:3.2 Nothing of survival value is ever lost in all the wide universe.


Things did not go as planned by our creators. Yet we are still being managed by an unseen celestial government. 

The Course in Miracles gives a brief description of the world veering from Gods plan for creation. From a thought process that challenged Gods will to Adam falling asleep. The Urantia Book goes into great detail about how our world was thrown into quarantine. 

One fact to keep in mind is that our world was quarantined long ago by our celestial family due to a series of unfortunate events. At some point in the distant future this quarantine will be lifted and we will be able to rejoin our celestial family. </Text>

The Sonship is our best understanding of who God is. All concepts beyond this temporal God are attempts to explain the unexplainable in terms of our own limited temporal language. Why is this important? 
The Urantia Book defines religion as a personal experience apart from theology. We cannot put these personal religious experiences into words, although we do try to relate our religious experience through our theology.

Why is there so much mystery surrounding miracles. Are they tied to our learning? Why do some people experience healing and not others? Can we discover the rules that govern these miracles and make healing a main stream common everyday occurrence? 

The UB gives us very detailed structure of our
We progressively grow and rise within a hierarchy of spiritual significance. As we rise in standing within the spiritual realm we gain increasingly more personal attention from our angels. We start out as babes in groups of 100, one angel overseeing 100 humans. As we mature we move to groups of 10? If we are fortunate we gain a personal angel to help us along the way.

It also plainly references the Holy Spirit and gives us details on how it operates. This provides additional insights into the mechanics of the mind. For instance, the Holy Spirit only see’s the real within our experiences and only amplifies these truths. It never attacks our own unreal world view. 
JCIM: The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because it is incapable of arrogance. It does not demand, because it does not seek control. It does not overcome, because it does not attack. It merely reminds. It is compelling only because of what it reminds you of. It brings to your mind the other way, remaining quiet even in the midst of the turmoil you have made for yourselves. The Voice for God is always quiet, because it speaks of peace. Yet peace is stronger than war because it heals. War is division, not increase. No one gains from strife.

The technique of how the CIM was communicated implies several ideas. Jesus does interact with each of us in a very personal way through his spirit of truth (comforter). The CIM gives us an example of how Jesus voice works with each of us. Also hints at how the Holy Spirits operates in our experience. (Actually this may be inaccurate since the UB says all spirit influence is almost indistinguishable from each source. We may though trial and error be able to distinguish between the spirit of truth, adjuster, Holy Spirit, angels. Not true for this author.

            <Text>The Goal
Transcendence 
Of The Temporal World

Spirit is a word that refers to a reality beyond words. We live in a time bound reality, yet we emerge from a timeless existence  the Urantia book gives us an incredible amount of information about how we arrived at our current state of existence. An attribute of infinity is that it is ever expanding. That is why it is changeless. If it stopped expanding that would be a change. 

In the CIM community it is believed by most that the material world does not exist. 

In the UB material world does exist but it can be transcended. As we transcend, the semispirit world (Morontia) becomes more real and the material world becomes less real. The UB acknowledges this does happen. 

The CIM says time and our body is a learning device. It acknowledges that the material world is real but real is a slippery term. Something real in time might not be real outside of time (eternity). We can say our bodies are real but they will not last an eternity. If you reside in eternity you might not regard anything in time as real because it has an ending. The Urantia book is full of statements about how time is perceived from the eternal perspective. 

Transcendence 
Fusion

Planet Earth in Transition

So just what is going on from God’s point of view? 
Current ideologies are being challenged. Great strain is being experienced by all inhabitants. 
A celestial government manages our destiny from the other side of the veil.

The UB does give us structure from our tiniest cells to how our mind works to how we ascend into the higher mind function provided to us by the mother spirit. It also gives us levels of progression up after this life. 

The end result of this trial and error of personal growth  is that we should be able to measure within our own experience, some positive experiences that will validate the study of these two books. If we put the principals described here into action, the laws of spirit will respond as promised. While it is qualitative measurement, it should also be life changing. 

Fusion is the goal
If you think you have established this course,  You definitely made progress, no effort is wasted. But the g oal of the course is transcendence of the temporal world. Material world. Little steps forward can save years of learning. We may bypass the need for certain training beyond this world. Yet the goal of the course is transcendence. Not a passive kind of transcendence but a proactive progress of personal achievement based on active experience. 

Transcendence 
We also make the assumption that transcendence is possible. The goal of the course. The progressive plan of the natural order of our word according to the UB, adjuster fusion.

More notes
Stream of thought

Transcendence, what is it? To those who live wholly in one realm, conflict is avoided. What are we transcending? Why is it such a mystery? Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world. What then does it mean, why does it have to be so mysterious? So Jesus kingdom is spiritual but he lived a material life in the flesh. He even created this material world. What is going on here? Why did he isolate us after administrators rebelled? Are we linked together in such a way that running the universe like a business was not an option. When you have bad management you simply replace them with good management. But our creator and CEO chose to isolate all who rebelled, as though ideologies are contagious. There is something deeper here. We are linked in ways we do not understand. The suffering of so many seems to be of little concern to the celestial overlords. So what is the eternal perspective of this situation? Sickness, suffering and death are not the norm in the universe. From a temporal perspective this situation is unacceptable. But would we feel that way if we knew the big picture, the master plan? 

Miscellaneous notes 
The course and Urantia book give us some pretty exciting possibilities if we want to push our mental training beyond current norms. The Course says forgiveness is the key to accessing the higher mind functions. The UB gives us plenty of information to help us understand what can happen should we push deeper into the superconscious. It gives us warnings and encouragement. Transcending our current conscious state was much further out of reach before these two books were available. Now we have an instruction book to show us the way. Pursue a path few have had the opportunity to pursue. 

We know from reading the Urantia book that it is possible to transcend this temporal reality and effect fusion with pure spirit reality, the indwelling divine monitor. This is more exciting than exploring space as an astronaut. And potentially much more rewarding. I suspect some have penetrated deep into the morontia realm of mind and are helping our celestial friends in what ever way they can. 

The Urantia book says our minds are not altogether limited by time. We do have the ability within our minds to seek eternal truths. It requires mind training. The Course offers us mind training from the eternal perspective. 

More on transcendence 
Words on pages do not adequately convey meainings to diverse minds. Rely on the Holy Spirit for guidance in all things. The course trains the mind to break free from historical/cultural teachings. The UB gives us a glimpse of what awaits us when we die or transcend this earth life. Both agree that death is not the only way. The idea of transcending this life is common to both books. The Urantia Book call’s it Adjuster Fusion. The Course in Miracles entire goal is to transition from the temporal to the eternal point of view. Both the Urantia book and the Course in Miracles says this transition is wrought with conflict. Below are quotes from each book about this warning. These quotes do illustrate the similarities they both have to the concept of transcending (fusing) rather than dying. 

The complexity comes from trying to reconcile the irreconcilable. Two competing  perspectives, the temporal and the eternal, create paradoxes in logic that can cause turmoil from a purely temporal point of view. (How can something linear exist in a nonlinear reality?)</Text>

The 20th century 

Miracles in the UB
120:4.5  Urantia mortals have varying concepts of the miraculous, but to us who live as citizens of the local universe there are few miracles, and of these by far the most intriguing are the incarnational bestowals of the Paradise Sons. The appearance in and on your world, by apparently natural processes, of a divine Son, we regard as a miracle — the operation of universal laws beyond our understanding. Jesus of Nazareth was a miraculous person.
.
136:8.2  Jesus very wisely foresaw that the working of miracles and the execution of wonders would call forth only outward allegiance by overawing the material mind; such performances would not reveal God nor save men. He refused to become a mere wonder-worker. He resolved to become occupied with but a single task — the establishment of the kingdom of heaven.


We are being taught by Jesus himself. The Course in Miracles is distilled learning of Jesus while he lived his life in the flesh. He created a path to the father that we all can follow. 


Use this to formulate paragraph about how many religions we have on the planet. 
45 - (103:1.1) The unity of religious experience among a social or racial group derives from the identical nature of the God fragment indwelling the individual. It is this divine in man that gives origin to his unselfish interest in the welfare of other men. But since personality is unique—no two mortals being alike—it inevitably follows that no two human beings can similarly interpret the leadings and urges of the spirit of divinity which lives within their minds. A group of mortals can experience spiritual unity, but they can never attain philosophic uniformity. And this diversity of the interpretation of religious thought and experience is shown by the fact that twentieth-century theologians and philosophers have formulated upward of five hundred different definitions of religion. In reality, every human being defines religion in the terms of his own experiential interpretation of the divine impulses emanating from the God spirit that indwells him, and therefore must such an interpretation be unique and wholly different from the religious philosophy of all other human beings.

Laws of spirit 
We should be able to reduce these to a set of laws of spirit that are repeatable. 


Perception versus Knowledge
Perception versus Knowledge
In the Course in Miracles the ego is the bad guy. Perception is a bad thing. Or so it seems at first glance. The CIM also refers to time as an illusion. If we look a little deeper, we may be surprised at what is being conveyed. 
The Course keeps things pretty simple in that the terminology is used consistently throughout the book. The word PERCEPTION refers to the animal mind, a purely time based view of reality. The animal mind has no clue of spirit reality. The word KNOWLEDGE refers to the eternal perspective. These two realities operate on very different levels. They are at odds with each other. The Course even says these two realities cannot communicate with each other. We know from the Urantia book that PERSONALITY (referred to as our WILL in the course) and the Divine Monitor (referred to as the SOUL in the course) work to bridge these two realities into a synthesized version of eternal reality. This synthesized creation is the purpose of time and space and material reality as we know it. The Urantia book calls this creation God the Supreme (referred to as the Sonship in the course). The Sonship will be made whole when all the souls are united as one. The Course tells us we are created in the image of God. Our purpose is to create as God creates. Our goal is to complete the Sonship. 

Beginnings of the Ego
In the temporal world we tend to see things as we experience them. A child thinks of itself as a body based on its lack of spiritual experience. It is purely ego driven and lives wholly in the world of perception. As we grow older, if we are fortunate enough to have religious experiences, we begin to have a more altruistic point of view. We may not be conscious of it but we see a kind of weak connection between each other, giving us an unselfish urge to help each other. This unselfish urge may not 

On normal worlds the individual is taught right perception from it’s visible celestial government. On our world, rebellion and default created an environment where our egos are inflated to such an extent that it impedes our creation. 

Difference between CIM and UB technique 
Jesus voice speaks to Helen in a nonverbal technique. It is somewhat of a mystery as to how this works. As we learn in the UB, Jesus taught his apostles and let them pass on knowledge rather than write down his instructions in his own words. Just as with the apostles, Jesus seems to rely on Helen and Bill to relay his teachings to us. Helen does an amazing job of being Jesus scribe. If you read the notes you realize they were having conversations and relating much personal information. This wealth of information needed to be edited into a book suitable for everyone. This process left much leeway to Bill and Helen when editing the notes.  

Your creations
Each one of us is equally as valuable as any other. No one will be left behind who wants to be a part of this creation. We are all adding to creation. What we are creating is enormous, unfathomable, humongous. What seems like the least of us in this life is not true in the grand creation. We are each irreplaceable.  

A deep dive into the relationship between the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. Some in the Urantia book overlook language that agrees with the Course. 

Why is the CIM so abstract? Does the Urantia book contain abstract concepts? The reason these concepts sound so hard is because they are asking us to consider a reality that is very different from the one we know. It is timeless, spaceless, 

UB: 102:8.7 True religion has nothing to do with alleged miracles, and never does revealed religion point to miracles as proof of authority. Religion is ever and always rooted and grounded in personal experience.
This quote contradicts the CIM. However, it also points out the limitations of personal revelation as opposed to epochal revelation. Jesus speaking to Helen was limited to Helen and Bills use of language. They considered a miracle to be more than the UB use of the term. In fact they saw miracles as a personal religious experience and more. They don’t use the term miracle as purely physical phenomenon. 

What would be the motivations of those who participated in the creation of these two books? Helen and Bill received no compensation from their participation in making the Course in Miracles a reality. Likewise, those involved in the publishing of the Urantia book received little attention or compensation. Both teams took many years to bring these books into being. Neither created a religious empire from them as previous religions did. 

Time and space are temporary constructs engineered for a specific purpose. They have limited value from an eternal perspective. 

Need a timeline in introduction, brief. UB started receiving papers in 1913 from an unknown contact personality who spoke in a trance. Continued until 1934. Published in 1950. Forum to study papers formed in .? Papers claim to be authored by 

Thoughts on CIM statements before time
This sounds like the creator describing the early days of creation when the creators were making decisions on what types of limits to build into the time-space creation. 
Jesus says time and space did not exist before the separation. It sounds like he may be describing the thought process back in the beginning of time. The Urantia book does say the creators built limitations into time and space to limit our free will choices. So maybe Jesus as creator is describing the early days when the creators were devising the limitations necessary to deal with the new realities of extending creation from the eternal to the temporal. 

quote: The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement itself began. The principle was love, and the Atonement itself was an act of love. Acts were not necessary before the separation because the time-space belief did not exist. It was only after the separation that the defense of Atonement and the necessary conditions for its fulfillment were planned.

Eternal point of view
From the eternal point of view, nothing temporal is real. That may seem shocking to students of either book but both state this as a reality. The UB says that to spirit being the material world is almost entirely unreal. The CIM OE entire course is designed to shift from a purely temporal viewpoint to an eternal viewpoint. The temporal is a subset of the eternal. Morontia is more enduring, spirit is the final goal. We created a temporal world with the primary goal to find God and be like him. 

Thrill of creation. 
We have a purpose in this life. We were created to create like the father. The infinite is ever expanding, that is why it never changes. It was created to extend. Nothing ca replace the thrill of creating like the Father. 

How do I attach my security to a faint voice that I can barely detect and not even sure when I’m making up something.

The UB and CIM give us enough information to reverse engineer what makes us up. We can use the intro to conduct experiments. Trial and error based on insights from these two books. 

Summary of objectives of both books....
The Urantia Book is about creating a balanced personality between our divine and human selves to eventually fuse them together as one. A Course in Miracles is the curriculum to deprogram the ego from the error inherent on a confused planet, train your mind to think from a place of pure sincerity so you learn to communicate with your divine self until there is no difference between your mind (thoughts) and God's mind and your desire to do God's will fuses you with your thought adjuster.

            <Text>Course in Miracles definition of terms in relation to the Urantia Book

Souls – Divine Monitor, Thought Adjuster, indestructible universe reality, perfection, center of the mortal soul, spirit monitor. 
Also, Altar seems to refer to the adjuster. 

The soul as referred to in the Course in Miracles can also be thought of as the Divine Monitor bestowed by God. It is considered to be the most indestructible form of reality indwelling the mind of man. It is the center of the soul and will become one with the evolving mortal identity. 

Perception – Adjutant mind, temporal levels of reality, 

Knowledge – Absolute level of reality, Thought Adjuster perspective, timeless state of being. 

Will – Personality, personal choice, bestowed by God, indestructible, achieves paradise irrespective of whether or not the human identity chooses eternal life. 

Sonship – God the Supreme, the evolving God of time and space, 

Identity – The creation of the personality in partnership with the Thought Adjuster (Divine Monitor). 

Consciousness – The Adjutant level of awareness. 

Superconscious – The Thought Adjuster, Holy Spirit?

Subconscious – Below animal mind?

Christ – Spirit of Truth?

Identity – One with the sonship.

Perception versus Knowledge
In the Course in Miracles the ego is the bad guy. Perception is a bad thing. Or so it seems at first glance. The CIM also refers to time as an illusion. If we look a little deeper, we may be surprised at what is being conveyed. 
The Course keeps things pretty simple in that the terminology is used consistently throughout the book. The word PERCEPTION refers to the animal mind, a purely time based view of reality. The animal mind has no clue of spirit reality. The word KNOWLEDGE refers to the eternal perspective. These two realities operate on very different levels. They are at odds with each other. The Course even says these two realities cannot communicate with each other. We know from the Urantia book that PERSONALITY (referred to as our WILL in the course) and the Divine Monitor (referred to as the SOUL in the course) work to bridge these two realities into a synthesized version of eternal reality. This synthesized creation is the purpose of time and space and material reality as we know it. The Urantia book calls this creation God the Supreme (referred to as the Sonship in the course). The Sonship will be made whole when all the souls are united as one. The Course tells us we are created in the image of God. Our purpose is to create as God creates. Our goal is to complete the Sonship. 

Beginnings of the Ego
In the temporal world we tend to see things as we experience them. A child thinks of itself as a body based on its lack of spiritual experience. It is purely ego driven and lives wholly in the world of perception. As we grow older, if we are fortunate enough to have religious experiences, we begin to have a more altruistic point of view. We may not be conscious of it but we see a kind of weak connection between each other, giving us an unselfish urge to help each other. This unselfish urge may not 

On normal worlds the ego is taught right perception from it’s visible celestial government. On our world, rebellion and default created an environment where our egos are inflated to such an extent that it impedes our creation.

            <Text>Why write and introduction?
https://www.publishtogetclients.com/foreword-preface-introduction-or-prologue-which-one/
Preface – A preface is written by the author of the book – YOU.  The goal of the Preface is to acquaint readers with any interesting background about the book before they jump into it. It often contains an explanation of how you, as author, came to write the book, such as your growing concern about an issue, or a personal incident that happened to you. It often also includes a section on who the book is for, and how to use the book if you want your readers to be aware of any specific recommendations. Some authors, for instance, tell readers which sections are most useful to various circumstances, or to read the book twice, or to go get a journal to write in while reading the book. Be aware that one rule of thumb is, you can’t assume that your readers will read your preface. So don’t get into any significant content issues in your preface. Assume readers may have skipped it.
Introduction – An introduction to a book is often used to take the place of a Preface, precisely because we know that many readers skip the Preface. By labeling nearly the same content an Introduction, it leads readers to believe they should read it. So basically, an Introduction serves the same purpose as a Preface, but just relabeling it makes it seem more pertinent and required reading. However, another difference is that an Introduction can begin to get into the actual content of your book. For instance, you might begin discussing the thesis of your book and the challenges we face in getting solutions for it. In this way, the Introduction serves to open up Chapter 1.</Text>

            <Text>Introduction



This study will examine conceptual models presented in two books, the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. This book is meant to appeal to students of either one or both. The Urantia Book was published in 1950. A version of The Course in Miracles was published in 1972 by Foundation for Inner Peace. We will not refer to FIP edition. We will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition. Both books have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. 
This book is meant to be a reference to parallels of conceptual models within these two books. Keep in mind that the terminology used in the two differ significantly. The Course is more abstract in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond words, you can only “know” as a result of experience. The Urantia book itself uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the term perception versus the term knowledge to refer to temporal versus eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe material, semi-spiritual, and spiritual points of view. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the divine monitor, thought adjuster, father fragment, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term soul to refer to God living within us. The soul as used in the Course in Miracles is the divine monitor, thought adjuster, and the father fragment. 
In this way the two books use different symantics to relate the same concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly.   
This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this book will win over some of the detractors from each community and open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  
There is no question that the two books we created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how these two books have so much in common. 
I will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. It will be tedious enough without other new age sources to confuse matters. The one source that will be referenced in addition will be the Bible.
Both have a very independent origin. Both have quite a unique history. Yet when we take a deeper look at the core concepts in each book, we see they are relate to each other  using slightly different language but the parallels are unmistakable. 






In the Course in Miracles Jesus’s voice is giving us insights on how to train our mind to fit into the world the world according to the Urantia book tells instead of the world we currently live in. 
The Urantia book expands on our current knowledge of the world we think we know. 
In this book we will make a few monumental assumptions. 
1. The first assumption is that the voice of Jesus dictated the Course in Miracles. Helen Schuman, the scribe of the Course in Miracles, claimed to hear a kind of nonverbal communication. This nonverbal voice identified himself as Jesus. She spent (check fact) 7 years taking shorthand notes each evening from the nonverbal voice. Her notes were edited many times until Helen and her partner in this endeavor Bill Thetford, arrived at an final edited version they felt comfortable with. 
The version of the CIM, completed in cooperation by Helen and Bill, will be used as reference in this book. This version predates the popular version of the CIM published by FIP. The Helen and Bill version contains additional pertinent information that was edited out of the FIP version. 
   2. The second assumption we make is that the claim of origin of the Urantia book is also accurate.  Jesus as creator, did also approve of another book to be provided by his subordinates  and associates. This book claims to be a major revelation of expanded cosmology. The Urantia book claims to be authored by a wide variety celestial beings, including angels and those beings of close association to the trinity itself. The book provides an enormous amount of information about our history, current standing in creation, the structure of creation, and our destiny and purpose. One fact to keep in mind is that our world was quarantined long ago by our celestial family due to a series of unfortunate events. At some point in the distant future this quarantine will be lifted and we will be able to rejoin our celestial family. 
The claim that the Course in Miracles was dictated by the voice of Jesus will never be proven as a fact. Likewise, the claim of the Urantia book being authored by celestial beings will never be proven. However, I do think you will be amazed by the remarkable coincidence of how the concepts within the Course in Miracles complement the Urantia book, both of which have distinct and unique stories of origin. The fact that these two books of different origin fit so well together should give some level of proof of something extraordinary occurring in and of itself. 
What would be the motivations of those who participated in the creation of these two books? Helen and Bill received no compensation from their participation in making the Course in Miracles a reality. Likewise, those involved in the publishing of the Urantia book received little attention or compensation. Both teams took many years to bring these books into being. Neither created a religious empire from them as previous religions did. 
These two assumptions cannot be proven. However, what you may find striking is the synergy between these two books. They complement each other well. The complexity within these books are high. Yet a deep dive into the  major concepts show quite striking similarities,

            <Text>Quote from online about what is a miracle
When I wake up in the morning with all my faculties and body parts intact, I consider it a miracle, especially if I can remember what I did yesterday and what I’m supposed to do today.  Definitely a miracle for me, which makes me exceedingly grateful. I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but many seemingly insignificant things are, to me, small miracles of truth, beauty and goodness . . . little flashes of light.  I  do think each person has their own definition of the miraculous, that which makes them feel connected to the transcendental level of reality . . .  the stuff that amazes them enough to cause wonder and inspire the heart to give thanks.

The CIM becomes much clearer when studied along side the Urantia Book. Concepts of perception and knowledge fit nicely with UB concepts of temporal and eternal.They are very complementary once differences in use of language are understood. 
The CIM can be quite abstract on its own. The UB gives some clarity about the goal of the CIM. Transcendence of material reality is discussed at length in both books. The goal of the course could be tied concept of adjuster fusion in the UB. </Text>

The 20th century 

Miracles in the UB
120:4.5  Urantia mortals have varying concepts of the miraculous, but to us who live as citizens of the local universe there are few miracles, and of these by far the most intriguing are the incarnational bestowals of the Paradise Sons. The appearance in and on your world, by apparently natural processes, of a divine Son, we regard as a miracle — the operation of universal laws beyond our understanding. Jesus of Nazareth was a miraculous person.
.
136:8.2  Jesus very wisely foresaw that the working of miracles and the execution of wonders would call forth only outward allegiance by overawing the material mind; such performances would not reveal God nor save men. He refused to become a mere wonder-worker. He resolved to become occupied with but a single task — the establishment of the kingdom of heaven.


We are being taught by Jesus himself. The Course in Miracles is distilled learning of Jesus while he lived his life in the flesh. He created a path to the father that we all can follow. 


Use this to formulate paragraph about how many religions we have on the planet. 
45 - (103:1.1) The unity of religious experience among a social or racial group derives from the identical nature of the God fragment indwelling the individual. It is this divine in man that gives origin to his unselfish interest in the welfare of other men. But since personality is unique—no two mortals being alike—it inevitably follows that no two human beings can similarly interpret the leadings and urges of the spirit of divinity which lives within their minds. A group of mortals can experience spiritual unity, but they can never attain philosophic uniformity. And this diversity of the interpretation of religious thought and experience is shown by the fact that twentieth-century theologians and philosophers have formulated upward of five hundred different definitions of religion. In reality, every human being defines religion in the terms of his own experiential interpretation of the divine impulses emanating from the God spirit that indwells him, and therefore must such an interpretation be unique and wholly different from the religious philosophy of all other human beings.

Laws of spirit 
We should be able to reduce these to a set of laws of spirit that are repeatable. 


Perception versus Knowledge
Perception versus Knowledge
In the Course in Miracles the ego is the bad guy. Perception is a bad thing. Or so it seems at first glance. The CIM also refers to time as an illusion. If we look a little deeper, we may be surprised at what is being conveyed. 
The Course keeps things pretty simple in that the terminology is used consistently throughout the book. The word PERCEPTION refers to the animal mind, a purely time based view of reality. The animal mind has no clue of spirit reality. The word KNOWLEDGE refers to the eternal perspective. These two realities operate on very different levels. They are at odds with each other. The Course even says these two realities cannot communicate with each other. We know from the Urantia book that PERSONALITY (referred to as our WILL in the course) and the Divine Monitor (referred to as the SOUL in the course) work to bridge these two realities into a synthesized version of eternal reality. This synthesized creation is the purpose of time and space and material reality as we know it. The Urantia book calls this creation God the Supreme (referred to as the Sonship in the course). The Sonship will be made whole when all the souls are united as one. The Course tells us we are created in the image of God. Our purpose is to create as God creates. Our goal is to complete the Sonship. 

Beginnings of the Ego
In the temporal world we tend to see things as we experience them. A child thinks of itself as a body based on its lack of spiritual experience.

On normal worlds the ego is taught right perception from it’s visible celestial government. On our world, rebellion and default created an environment where our egos are inflated to such an extent that it impedes our creation. 

Difference between CIM and UB technique 
Jesus voice speaks to Helen in a nonverbal technique. It is somewhat of a mystery as to how this works. As we learn in the UB, Jesus taught his apostles and let them pass on knowledge rather than write down his instructions in his own words. Just as with the apostles, Jesus seems to rely on Helen and Bill to relay his teachings to us. Helen does an amazing job of being Jesus scribe. If you read the notes you realize they were having conversations and relating much personal information. This wealth of information needed to be edited into a book suitable for everyone. This process left much leeway to Bill and Helen when editing the notes.  

Your creations
Each one of us is equally as valuable as any other. No one will be left behind who wants to be a part of this creation. We are all adding to creation. What we are creating is enormous, unfathomable, humongous. What seems like the least of us in this life is not true in the grand creation. We are each irreplaceable.  

A deep dive into the relationship between the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. Some in the Urantia book overlook language that agrees with the Course. 

Why is the CIM so abstract? Does the Urantia book contain abstract concepts? The reason these concepts sound so hard is because they are asking us to consider a reality that is very different from the one we know. It is timeless, spaceless, 

UB: 102:8.7 True religion has nothing to do with alleged miracles, and never does revealed religion point to miracles as proof of authority. Religion is ever and always rooted and grounded in personal experience.
This quote contradicts the CIM. However, it also points out the limitations of personal revelation as opposed to epochal revelation. Jesus speaking to Helen was limited to Helen and Bills use of language. They considered a miracle to be more than the UB use of the term. In fact they saw miracles as a personal religious experience and more. They don’t use the term miracle as purely physical phenomenon. 

What would be the motivations of those who participated in the creation of these two books? Helen and Bill received no compensation from their participation in making the Course in Miracles a reality. Likewise, those involved in the publishing of the Urantia book received little attention or compensation. Both teams took many years to bring these books into being. Neither created a religious empire from them as previous religions did. 

Time and space are temporary constructs engineered for a specific purpose. They have limited value from an eternal perspective. 

Need a timeline in introduction, brief. UB started receiving papers in 1913 from an unknown contact personality who spoke in a trance. Continued until 1934. Published in 1950. Forum to study papers formed in .? Papers claim to be authored by 

Thoughts on CIM statements before time
This sounds like the creator describing the early days of creation when the creators were making decisions on what types of limits to build into the time-space creation. 
Jesus says time and space did not exist before the separation. It sounds like he may be describing the thought process back in the beginning of time. The Urantia book does say the creators built limitations into time and space to limit our free will choices. So maybe Jesus as creator is describing the early days when the creators were devising the limitations necessary to deal with the new realities of extending creation from the eternal to the temporal. 

quote: The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement itself began. The principle was love, and the Atonement itself was an act of love. Acts were not necessary before the separation because the time-space belief did not exist. It was only after the separation that the defense of Atonement and the necessary conditions for its fulfillment were planned.

Eternal point of view
From the eternal point of view, nothing temporal is real. That may seem shocking to students of either book but both state this as a reality. The UB says that to spirit being the material world is almost entirely unreal. The CIM OE entire course is designed to shift from a purely temporal viewpoint to an eternal viewpoint. The temporal is a subset of the eternal. Moro Gia is more enduring, spirit is the final goal. We created a temporal world with the primary goal to find God and be like him. 

Thrill of creation. 
We have a purpose in this life. We were created to create like the father. The infinite is ever expanding, that is why it never changes. It was created to extend. Nothing ca replace the thrill of creating like the Father. 


Angels tried to murder fellow angels. Even the celestial beings can go astray. The authors of the UB learned from Jesus bestowal. And they were limited in what they could write by the mandate. </Text>

The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was published in 1972 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. However, we will not refer to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition. Instead we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition. Both books have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. 
In the beginning of the 19th century Jesus (Michael) approved of a plan to provide us with an expanded revelation of our Heavenly Father and his creation. The Urantia Book was written by a wide variety of celestial beings with varied origins and backgrounds. It claims no human authorship.  Neither did Jesus personally author any of the papers in the Urantia book. 
In 1972 Jesus began a collaboration with Helen Schumann and Bill Thetford on the Course in Miracles.  Jesus relied on Helen and Bill to deliver his message just as he relied on the apostles. Jesus left no writings behind during his life in the flesh. He knew there was a danger of men turning his words into crystallized dogma. So he left the responsibility to deliver his message to his apostles. We know from the Urantia book that that decision had limited success. The apostles did their best to relate his message to the masses. 
We also know that the authors of the Urantia Book were limited in what they were allowed to write. It says overrevelation “would deprive the thinking mortals of the next thousand years of that stimulus to creative speculation which these partially revealed concepts supply”.

The terminology used in these two books differ significantly. Words can convey multiple meanings. 

Course in Miracles OE: Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality.

Urantia Book: 0:12.13 We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of our assignment; we recognize the impossibility of fully translating the language of the concepts of divinity and eternity into the symbols of the language of the finite concepts of the mortal mind. 

The Course is more abstract in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond words, you can only “know” as a result of religious experience. The Urantia book uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the terms perception and knowledge to refer to designate between temporal and eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal (UB:adjutant) mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe multiple points of view including material and spiritual. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the divine monitor, thought adjuster, father fragment, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term soul to refer to God living within us. In this way the two books use different symantics to relate concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly. Each book enhances and expands the other. 
This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this book will open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  
There is no question that the two books we created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how the two books have so much in common. 
I will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. The one source that will be referenced in addition will be the Bible.

Stunning parallels to the Urantia book found in the Course in Miracles reveal a different perspective from current interpretations of the Course in Miracles community. 

The Urantia Book is about creating a balanced personality between our divine and human selves to eventually fuse them together as one. A Course in Miracles is the curriculum to deprogram the ego from the error inherent on a confused planet, train your mind to think from a place of pure sincerity so you learn to communicate with your divine self until there is no difference between your mind (thoughts) and God's mind and your desire to do God's will fuses you with your thought adjuster.

In the Course in Miracles Jesus’s voice is giving us insights on how to train our mind to fit into the world the world according to the Urantia book instead of the world we currently live in. 
The Urantia book expands on our current knowledge of the world we think we know. 
In this book we will make a few assumptions. 
1. The first assumption is that the voice of Jesus dictated the Course in Miracles. Helen Schuman, the scribe of the Course in Miracles, claimed to hear a kind of nonverbal communication. This nonverbal voice identified himself as Jesus. She spent (check fact) 7 years taking shorthand notes each evening from the nonverbal voice. Her notes were edited many times until Helen and her partner in this endeavor Bill Thetford, arrived at an final edited version they felt comfortable with. 
The version of the CIM, completed in cooperation by Helen and Bill, will be used as reference in this book. This version predates the popular version of the CIM published by FIP. The Helen and Bill version contains additional pertinent information that was edited out of the FIP version. 
   2. The second assumption we make is that the claim of origin of the Urantia book is also accurate.  Jesus as creator, did also approve of another book to be provided by his subordinates  and associates. This book claims to be a major revelation of expanded cosmology. The Urantia book claims to be authored by a wide variety celestial beings, including angels and those beings of close association to the trinity itself. The book provides an enormous amount of information about our history, current standing in creation, the structure of creation, and our destiny and purpose.
The claim that the Course in Miracles was dictated by the voice of Jesus will never be proven as a fact. Likewise, the claim that the Urantia book was authored by celestial beings will never be proven. However, I do think you will be amazed by the remarkable coincidence of how the concepts within the Course in Miracles complement the Urantia book, both of which have distinct and unique stories of origin. The fact that these two books of different origin fit so well together should give some level of proof of something extraordinary occurring in and of itself. 

These two assumptions cannot be proven. However, what you may find striking is the synergy between these two books. They complement each other well. The complexity within these books are high. Yet a deep dive into the  major concepts show quite striking similarities, 

At first glance the Course seems to be lacking in structure that would agree with the Urantia book. For there to be symmetry it would need to acknowledge personality, the Holy Spirt, the Spirit of Truth, the adjutant mind, and the universe. But it is a course in mind training and not meant to be a book about cosmology. While it seems to leave out the cosmology from the Urantia book, it does have more than appears on the surface.</Text>

The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept.

This book will compare conceptual models presented in the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was published in 1972 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. However, we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition or the Hugh Lynn Casey edition. Both the Urantia Book and a Course in Miracles have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. At first glance the two seem to embrace incompatible conceptual models. A deeper look will reveal surprising consistency. The complexity within each book is high yet a deep dive into the  major concepts show quite striking similarities. 
We are making several assumptions that cannot be proven. Consider the following. In the beginning of the 19th century Jesus (Michael) approved of a plan to provide us with an expanded revelation of our Heavenly Father in the form of the Urantia Book. The Urantia Book was written by a wide variety of celestial beings with varied origins and backgrounds. It claims no human authorship.  Neither did Jesus personally author any of the papers in the Urantia book. Instead, Jesus let his celestial cohorts give their testimony just as he did with the Apostles.  
In 1972 Jesus began a collaboration with Helen Schumann and Bill Thetford on the Course in Miracles.  Jesus relied on Helen and Bill to deliver his message similar to the way he relied on the apostles to be his messengers. Jesus left no writings behind during his life in the flesh. He knew there was a danger of men turning his words into crystallized dogma. So he left the responsibility to deliver his message to his apostles. We know from the Urantia book that that decision had limited success. The apostles did their best to relate his message to the masses. But even this limited success was preferable to Jesus. He choose to rely on his apostles as opposed to leaving behind a record of his writing in his own words for fear of danger that they would be crystallized.

This study will compare conceptual models presented in the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. This book is meant to appeal to students of either one or both books. The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was published in 1972 by Foundation for Inner Peace. We will not refer to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition. Instead we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition. Both books have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. 
This book is a reference to parallels of conceptual models within these two books. Keep in mind that the terminology used in the two differ significantly. The Course is more abstract in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond words, you can only “know” as a result of experience. The Urantia book uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the term perception versus knowledge to refer to temporal versus eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe material, semi-spiritual, and spiritual points of view. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the divine monitor, thought adjuster, father fragment, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term soul to refer to God living within us. The soul as used in the Course in Miracles is the divine monitor, thought adjuster, and the father fragment. 
In this way the two books use different symantics to relate the same concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly.   
This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this book will open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  
There is no question that the two books we created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how the two books have so much in common. 
I will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. The one source that will be referenced in addition will be the Bible.

Stunning parallels to the Urantia book found in the Course in Miracles reveal a different perspective from current interpretations of the Course in Miracles community. 

The Urantia Book is about creating a balanced personality between our divine and human selves to eventually fuse them together as one. A Course in Miracles is the curriculum to deprogram the ego from the error inherent on a confused planet, train your mind to think from a place of pure sincerity so you learn to communicate with your divine self until there is no difference between your mind (thoughts) and God's mind and your desire to do God's will fuses you with your thought adjuster.

In the Course in Miracles Jesus’s voice is giving us insights on how to train our mind to fit into the world the world according to the Urantia book instead of the world we currently live in. 
The Urantia book expands on our current knowledge of the world we think we know. 
In this book we will make a few monumental assumptions. 
1. The first assumption is that the voice of Jesus dictated the Course in Miracles. Helen Schuman, the scribe of the Course in Miracles, claimed to hear a kind of nonverbal communication. This nonverbal voice identified himself as Jesus. She spent (check fact) 7 years taking shorthand notes each evening from the nonverbal voice. Her notes were edited many times until Helen and her partner in this endeavor Bill Thetford, arrived at an final edited version they felt comfortable with. 
The version of the CIM, completed in cooperation by Helen and Bill, will be used as reference in this book. This version predates the popular version of the CIM published by FIP. The Helen and Bill version contains additional pertinent information that was edited out of the FIP version. 
   2. The second assumption we make is that the claim of origin of the Urantia book is also accurate.  Jesus as creator, did also approve of another book to be provided by his subordinates  and associates. This book claims to be a major revelation of expanded cosmology. The Urantia book claims to be authored by a wide variety celestial beings, including angels and those beings of close association to the trinity itself. The book provides an enormous amount of information about our history, current standing in creation, the structure of creation, and our destiny and purpose.
The claim that the Course in Miracles was dictated by the voice of Jesus will never be proven as a fact. Likewise, the claim that the Urantia book was authored by celestial beings will never be proven. However, I do think you will be amazed by the remarkable coincidence of how the concepts within the Course in Miracles complement the Urantia book, both of which have distinct and unique stories of origin. The fact that these two books of different origin fit so well together should give some level of proof of something extraordinary occurring in and of itself. 

These two assumptions cannot be proven. However, what you may find striking is the synergy between these two books. They complement each other well. The complexity within these books are high. Yet a deep dive into the  major concepts show quite striking similarities, 

At first glance the Course seems to be lacking in structure that would agree with the Urantia book. For there to be symmetry it would need to acknowledge personality, the Holy Spirt, the Spirit of Truth, the adjutant mind, and the universe. But it is a course in mind training and not meant to be a book about cosmology. While it seems to leave out the cosmology from the Urantia book, it does have more than appears on the surface.</Text>

The 20th century 

Miracles in the UB
120:4.5  Urantia mortals have varying concepts of the miraculous, but to us who live as citizens of the local universe there are few miracles, and of these by far the most intriguing are the incarnational bestowals of the Paradise Sons. The appearance in and on your world, by apparently natural processes, of a divine Son, we regard as a miracle — the operation of universal laws beyond our understanding. Jesus of Nazareth was a miraculous person.
.
136:8.2  Jesus very wisely foresaw that the working of miracles and the execution of wonders would call forth only outward allegiance by overawing the material mind; such performances would not reveal God nor save men. He refused to become a mere wonder-worker. He resolved to become occupied with but a single task — the establishment of the kingdom of heaven.


We are being taught by Jesus himself. The Course in Miracles is distilled learning of Jesus while he lived his life in the flesh. He created a path to the father that we all can follow. 


Use this to formulate paragraph about how many religions we have on the planet. 
45 - (103:1.1) The unity of religious experience among a social or racial group derives from the identical nature of the God fragment indwelling the individual. It is this divine in man that gives origin to his unselfish interest in the welfare of other men. But since personality is unique—no two mortals being alike—it inevitably follows that no two human beings can similarly interpret the leadings and urges of the spirit of divinity which lives within their minds. A group of mortals can experience spiritual unity, but they can never attain philosophic uniformity. And this diversity of the interpretation of religious thought and experience is shown by the fact that twentieth-century theologians and philosophers have formulated upward of five hundred different definitions of religion. In reality, every human being defines religion in the terms of his own experiential interpretation of the divine impulses emanating from the God spirit that indwells him, and therefore must such an interpretation be unique and wholly different from the religious philosophy of all other human beings.

Laws of spirit 
We should be able to reduce these to a set of laws of spirit that are repeatable. 


Perception versus Knowledge
Perception versus Knowledge
In the Course in Miracles the ego is the bad guy. Perception is a bad thing. Or so it seems at first glance. The CIM also refers to time as an illusion. If we look a little deeper, we may be surprised at what is being conveyed. 
The Course keeps things pretty simple in that the terminology is used consistently throughout the book. The word PERCEPTION refers to the animal mind, a purely time based view of reality. The animal mind has no clue of spirit reality. The word KNOWLEDGE refers to the eternal perspective. These two realities operate on very different levels. They are at odds with each other. The Course even says these two realities cannot communicate with each other. We know from the Urantia book that PERSONALITY (referred to as our WILL in the course) and the Divine Monitor (referred to as the SOUL in the course) work to bridge these two realities into a synthesized version of eternal reality. This synthesized creation is the purpose of time and space and material reality as we know it. The Urantia book calls this creation God the Supreme (referred to as the Sonship in the course). The Sonship will be made whole when all the souls are united as one. The Course tells us we are created in the image of God. Our purpose is to create as God creates. Our goal is to complete the Sonship. 

Beginnings of the Ego
In the temporal world we tend to see things as we experience them. A child thinks of itself as a body based on its lack of spiritual experience. It is purely ego driven and lives wholly in the world of perception. As we grow older, if we are fortunate enough to have religious experiences, we begin to have a more altruistic point of view. We may not be conscious of it but we see a kind of weak connection between each other, giving us an unselfish urge to help each other. This unselfish urge may not 

On normal worlds the ego is taught right perception from it’s visible celestial government. On our world, rebellion and default created an environment where our egos are inflated to such an extent that it impedes our creation. 

Difference between CIM and UB technique 
Jesus voice speaks to Helen in a nonverbal technique. It is somewhat of a mystery as to how this works. As we learn in the UB, Jesus taught his apostles and let them pass on knowledge rather than write down his instructions in his own words. Just as with the apostles, Jesus seems to rely on Helen and Bill to relay his teachings to us. Helen does an amazing job of being Jesus scribe. If you read the notes you realize they were having conversations and relating much personal information. This wealth of information needed to be edited into a book suitable for everyone. This process left much leeway to Bill and Helen when editing the notes.  

Your creations
Each one of us is equally as valuable as any other. No one will be left behind who wants to be a part of this creation. We are all adding to creation. What we are creating is enormous, unfathomable, humongous. What seems like the least of us in this life is not true in the grand creation. We are each irreplaceable.  

A deep dive into the relationship between the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. Some in the Urantia book overlook language that agrees with the Course. 

Why is the CIM so abstract? Does the Urantia book contain abstract concepts? The reason these concepts sound so hard is because they are asking us to consider a reality that is very different from the one we know. It is timeless, spaceless, 

UB: 102:8.7 True religion has nothing to do with alleged miracles, and never does revealed religion point to miracles as proof of authority. Religion is ever and always rooted and grounded in personal experience.
This quote contradicts the CIM. However, it also points out the limitations of personal revelation as opposed to epochal revelation. Jesus speaking to Helen was limited to Helen and Bills use of language. They considered a miracle to be more than the UB use of the term. In fact they saw miracles as a personal religious experience and more. They don’t use the term miracle as purely physical phenomenon. 

What would be the motivations of those who participated in the creation of these two books? Helen and Bill received no compensation from their participation in making the Course in Miracles a reality. Likewise, those involved in the publishing of the Urantia book received little attention or compensation. Both teams took many years to bring these books into being. Neither created a religious empire from them as previous religions did. 

Time and space are temporary constructs engineered for a specific purpose. They have limited value from an eternal perspective. 

Need a timeline in introduction, brief. UB started receiving papers in 1913 from an unknown contact personality who spoke in a trance. Continued until 1934. Published in 1950. Forum to study papers formed in .? Papers claim to be authored by 

Thoughts on CIM statements before time
This sounds like the creator describing the early days of creation when the creators were making decisions on what types of limits to build into the time-space creation. 
Jesus says time and space did not exist before the separation. It sounds like he may be describing the thought process back in the beginning of time. The Urantia book does say the creators built limitations into time and space to limit our free will choices. So maybe Jesus as creator is describing the early days when the creators were devising the limitations necessary to deal with the new realities of extending creation from the eternal to the temporal. 

quote: The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement itself began. The principle was love, and the Atonement itself was an act of love. Acts were not necessary before the separation because the time-space belief did not exist. It was only after the separation that the defense of Atonement and the necessary conditions for its fulfillment were planned.

Eternal point of view
From the eternal point of view, nothing temporal is real. That may seem shocking to students of either book but both state this as a reality. The UB says that to spirit being the material world is almost entirely unreal. The CIM OE entire course is designed to shift from a purely temporal viewpoint to an eternal viewpoint. The temporal is a subset of the eternal. Moro Gia is more enduring, spirit is the final goal. We created a temporal world with the primary goal to find God and be like him. 

Thrill of creation. 
We have a purpose in this life. We were created to create like the father. The infinite is ever expanding, that is why it never changes. It was created to extend. Nothing ca replace the thrill of creating like the Father. 


Angels tried to murder fellow angels. Even the celestial beings can go astray. The authors of the UB learned from Jesus bestowal. And they were limited in what they could write by the mandate. </Text>

This has caused confusion within these two communities. The cim is adstract, UB is 

The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was published in 1972 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. However, we will not refer to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition. Instead we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition. Both books have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. 
In the beginning of the 19th century Jesus (Michael) approved of a plan to provide us with an expanded revelation of our Heavenly Father and his creation. The Urantia Book was written by a wide variety of celestial beings with varied origins and backgrounds. It claims no human authorship.  Neither did Jesus personally author any of the papers in the Urantia book. 
In 1972 Jesus began a collaboration with Helen Schumann and Bill Thetford on the Course in Miracles.  Jesus relied on Helen and Bill to deliver his message just as he relied on the apostles. Jesus left no writings behind during his life in the flesh. He knew there was a danger of men turning his words into crystallized dogma. So he left the responsibility to deliver his message to his apostles. We know from the Urantia book that that decision had limited success. The apostles did their best to relate his message to the masses. 
We also know that the authors of the Urantia Book were limited in what they were allowed to write. It says overrevelation “would deprive the thinking mortals of the next thousand years of that stimulus to creative speculation which these partially revealed concepts supply”.

The terminology used in these two books differ significantly. Words can convey multiple meanings.

Stunning parallels to the Urantia book found in the Course in Miracles reveal a different perspective from current interpretations of the Course in Miracles community. 

The Urantia Book is about creating a balanced personality between our divine and human selves to eventually fuse them together as one. A Course in Miracles is the curriculum to deprogram the ego from the error inherent on a confused planet, train your mind to think from a place of pure sincerity so you learn to communicate with your divine self until there is no difference between your mind (thoughts) and God's mind and your desire to do God's will fuses you with your thought adjuster.

In the Course in Miracles Jesus’s voice is giving us insights on how to train our mind to fit into the world the world according to the Urantia book instead of the world we currently live in. 
The Urantia book expands on our current knowledge of the world we think we know. 
In this book we will make a few monumental assumptions. 
1. The first assumption is that the voice of Jesus dictated the Course in Miracles. Helen Schuman, the scribe of the Course in Miracles, claimed to hear a kind of nonverbal communication. This nonverbal voice identified himself as Jesus. She spent (check fact) 7 years taking shorthand notes each evening from the nonverbal voice. Her notes were edited many times until Helen and her partner in this endeavor Bill Thetford, arrived at an final edited version they felt comfortable with. 
The version of the CIM, completed in cooperation by Helen and Bill, will be used as reference in this book. This version predates the popular version of the CIM published by FIP. The Helen and Bill version contains additional pertinent information that was edited out of the FIP version. 
   2. The second assumption we make is that the claim of origin of the Urantia book is also accurate.  Jesus as creator, did also approve of another book to be provided by his subordinates  and associates. This book claims to be a major revelation of expanded cosmology. The Urantia book claims to be authored by a wide variety celestial beings, including angels and those beings of close association to the trinity itself. The book provides an enormous amount of information about our history, current standing in creation, the structure of creation, and our destiny and purpose.
The claim that the Course in Miracles was dictated by the voice of Jesus will never be proven as a fact. Likewise, the claim that the Urantia book was authored by celestial beings will never be proven. However, I do think you will be amazed by the remarkable coincidence of how the concepts within the Course in Miracles complement the Urantia book, both of which have distinct and unique stories of origin. The fact that these two books of different origin fit so well together should give some level of proof of something extraordinary occurring in and of itself. 

These two assumptions cannot be proven. However, what you may find striking is the synergy between these two books. They complement each other well. The complexity within these books are high. Yet a deep dive into the  major concepts show quite striking similarities, 

At first glance the Course seems to be lacking in structure that would agree with the Urantia book. For there to be symmetry it would need to acknowledge personality, the Holy Spirt, the Spirit of Truth, the adjutant mind, and the universe. But it is a course in mind training and not meant to be a book about cosmology. While it seems to leave out the cosmology from the Urantia book, it does have more than appears on the surface.</Text>

            <Text>Introduction


The nineteenth century will become known as a major turning point for religion. 
Each book enhances and expands the other. 


CIM: Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality.
UB: 4 - (0:12.13) We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of our assignment; we recognize the impossibility of fully translating the language of the concepts of divinity and eternity into the symbols of the language of the finite concepts of the mortal mind. 

This study will compare conceptual models presented in the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. This book is meant to appeal to students of either one or both books. The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was published in 1972 by Foundation for Inner Peace. We will not refer to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition. Instead we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition. Both books have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. 
This book is a reference to parallels of conceptual models within these two books. Keep in mind that the terminology used in the two differ significantly. The Course is more abstract in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond words, you can only “know” as a result of experience. The Urantia book uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the term perception versus knowledge to refer to temporal versus eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe material, semi-spiritual, and spiritual points of view. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the divine monitor, thought adjuster, father fragment, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term soul to refer to God living within us. The soul as used in the Course in Miracles is the divine monitor, thought adjuster, and the father fragment. 
In this way the two books use different symantics to relate the same concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly.   
This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this book will open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  
There is no question that the two books we created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how the two books have so much in common. 
I will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. The one source that will be referenced in addition will be the Bible.

Thorpe Saxton Good quote. That quote is not just a play on words by the revelators.  This is a view from the eternal perspective. The temporal is temporary by definition. As massive as the seven super universes are, they will one day be settled and time will exhaust all potentials. We will have learned everything we can from the “simulation”, the sonship.

            <Text>Introduction

This book will compare conceptual models presented in the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was first published in 1972 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. However, we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition or the Hugh Lynn Casey edition. Both the Urantia Book and a Course in Miracles have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. At first glance the two seem to embrace incompatible conceptual models. A deeper look will reveal surprising consistency.
In the beginning of the 19th century Jesus (Michael) approved of a plan to provide us with an expanded revelation of our Heavenly Father in the form of a book. The Urantia Book was written by a wide variety of celestial beings with varied origins and backgrounds. It claims no human authorship.  Neither did Jesus personally author any of the papers in the Urantia book. Instead, Jesus let his celestial cohorts give their testimony.
In 1972 Jesus began a collaboration with Helen Schumann and Bill Thetford on the Course in Miracles. He related lessons learned during his life in the flesh. While he did collaborate on the Course in Miracles with Helen, he gave them freedom to edit it as they thought best. Jesus relied on Helen and Bill to deliver his message.
In both books Jesus used the same approach of letting his associates do the talking. According to the Urantia book Jesus left no writings behind during his life in the flesh. He knew there was a danger of men turning his words into crystallized dogma. So he left the responsibility to deliver his message to his apostles. We know from the Urantia book that that decision had limited success. The apostles did their best to relate his message to the masses. But even this limited success was preferable to Jesus. He choose to rely on his apostles as opposed to leaving behind a record of his writing in his own words to prevent them from being crystallized. Spirit reality is simply beyond description. 

Terminology 

The terminology used in these two books differ significantly. Words can convey multiple meanings. This has been the major obstacle in comparing these two book. Both books point out the limitations of language. 

Course in Miracles OE: Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality.

Urantia Book: 0:12.13 We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of our assignment; we recognize the impossibility of fully translating the language of the concepts of divinity and eternity into the symbols of the language of the finite concepts of the mortal mind. 

The Course takes a more abstract approach in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond words, you can only “know” as a result of religious experience. The Urantia book uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the terms perception and knowledge to designate between temporal and eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal (UB:adjutant) mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe multiple points of view including material and spiritual. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the divine monitor, thought adjuster, father fragment, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term soul to refer to God living within us. In this way the two books use different symantics to relate similar concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly. Each book enhances and expands the other. 

Community

This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this book will open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  
There is no question that the two books were created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how the two books have so much in common. 


This study will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. 


This should be at the end of the j trifurcation 
The struggle to understand the CIM in relation to the UB is worth it. 
100:4.2 Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised in behalf of the great, the good, the true, and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual VISION and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving.

The Master Plan
A Peek Beyond The Veil

Many of us know from personal experience that something profound exists apart from our material world. Something we call spirit, God, infinity, eternity, and many other labels that tease our logical minds with mystery and wonder. 
We are experiencing a tug of war within ourselves. Seek and ye shall find may be true in our experience of spirit but we still struggle to translate that experience into language that we can all agree on. This disunity of thought is evident by the number of religions created to explain the mystery of our existence. 
Metaphysics has attempted to unify this gap between the temporal and the eternal. But is it possible to reverse engineer our reality from the bottom up? If we define religion as our personal experience with God, can we unite science and religion into a cohesive philosophy for living? Can we 
Theology seems to have reached its limits in its ability to explain spirituality in modern terms. Metaphysics has picked up the mantle of trying to push deeper into the unknown. Science is pushing the envelope on quantum mechanics attempting to reverse engineer material reality. Philosophy continues to evolve its world model and our place in it. Yet today we are being bombarded with more theories of everything. Instead of answers we have disunity of thought. Today is a struggle for a quality of thinking. We need clarity more than every in this confusing world. 



Jews had scripture that represented their highest concept of mans place in the cosmos. 
Today we have the Bible that represents our best understanding of our place in creation. 
Could it be possible that Jesus approved of an enhanced revelation  that builds on the past revelations? 
Jesus approved of a book that reveals 
It says overmuch revelation is harmful. Time has to pass after each increased revelation of truth. 
What purpose does this life serve? Why were we created. Why is spirit so mysterious? 
How do we gain access to this world of the spirit?  What is the grand plan of  creation? 
Peace seems boring in a world of excitement and riches. We can push the boundaries of our mind by making peace of mind a goal.
Access to intuition




Jesus knew something we still do not know. He knew the master plan. Our world was created to fulfill a purpose. 

The Urantia book says we need additional revelation from time to time to help us move past blocks we would never otherwise move past.

The 20th century 

Miracles in the UB
120:4.5  Urantia mortals have varying concepts of the miraculous, but to us who live as citizens of the local universe there are few miracles, and of these by far the most intriguing are the incarnational bestowals of the Paradise Sons. The appearance in and on your world, by apparently natural processes, of a divine Son, we regard as a miracle — the operation of universal laws beyond our understanding. Jesus of Nazareth was a miraculous person.
.
136:8.2  Jesus very wisely foresaw that the working of miracles and the execution of wonders would call forth only outward allegiance by overawing the material mind; such performances would not reveal God nor save men. He refused to become a mere wonder-worker. He resolved to become occupied with but a single task — the establishment of the kingdom of heaven.


We are being taught by Jesus himself. The Course in Miracles is distilled learning of Jesus while he lived his life in the flesh. He created a path to the father that we all can follow. 


Use this to formulate paragraph about how many religions we have on the planet. 
45 - (103:1.1) The unity of religious experience among a social or racial group derives from the identical nature of the God fragment indwelling the individual. It is this divine in man that gives origin to his unselfish interest in the welfare of other men. But since personality is unique—no two mortals being alike—it inevitably follows that no two human beings can similarly interpret the leadings and urges of the spirit of divinity which lives within their minds. A group of mortals can experience spiritual unity, but they can never attain philosophic uniformity. And this diversity of the interpretation of religious thought and experience is shown by the fact that twentieth-century theologians and philosophers have formulated upward of five hundred different definitions of religion. In reality, every human being defines religion in the terms of his own experiential interpretation of the divine impulses emanating from the God spirit that indwells him, and therefore must such an interpretation be unique and wholly different from the religious philosophy of all other human beings.

Laws of spirit 
We should be able to reduce these to a set of laws of spirit that are repeatable. 


Perception versus Knowledge
Perception versus Knowledge
In the Course in Miracles the ego is the bad guy. Perception is a bad thing. Or so it seems at first glance. The CIM also refers to time as an illusion. If we look a little deeper, we may be surprised at what is being conveyed. 
The Course keeps things pretty simple in that the terminology is used consistently throughout the book. The word PERCEPTION refers to the animal mind, a purely time based view of reality. The animal mind has no clue of spirit reality. The word KNOWLEDGE refers to the eternal perspective. These two realities operate on very different levels. They are at odds with each other. The Course even says these two realities cannot communicate with each other. We know from the Urantia book that PERSONALITY (referred to as our WILL in the course) and the Divine Monitor (referred to as the SOUL in the course) work to bridge these two realities into a synthesized version of eternal reality. This synthesized creation is the purpose of time and space and material reality as we know it. The Urantia book calls this creation God the Supreme (referred to as the Sonship in the course). The Sonship will be made whole when all the souls are united as one. The Course tells us we are created in the image of God. Our purpose is to create as God creates. Our goal is to complete the Sonship. 

Beginnings of the Ego
In the temporal world we tend to see things as we experience them. A child thinks of itself as a body based on its lack of spiritual experience. It is purely ego driven and lives wholly in the world of perception. As we grow older, if we are fortunate enough to have religious experiences, we begin to have a more altruistic point of view. We may not be conscious of it but we see a kind of weak connection between each other, giving us an unselfish urge to help each other. This unselfish urge may not 

On normal worlds the ego is taught right perception from it’s visible celestial government. On our world, rebellion and default created an environment where our egos are inflated to such an extent that it impedes our creation. 

Difference between CIM and UB technique 
Jesus voice speaks to Helen in a nonverbal technique. It is somewhat of a mystery as to how this works. As we learn in the UB, Jesus taught his apostles and let them pass on knowledge rather than write down his instructions in his own words. Just as with the apostles, Jesus seems to rely on Helen and Bill to relay his teachings to us. Helen does an amazing job of being Jesus scribe. If you read the notes you realize they were having conversations and relating much personal information. This wealth of information needed to be edited into a book suitable for everyone. This process left much leeway to Bill and Helen when editing the notes.  

Your creations
Each one of us is equally as valuable as any other. No one will be left behind who wants to be a part of this creation. We are all adding to creation. What we are creating is enormous, unfathomable, humongous. What seems like the least of us in this life is not true in the grand creation. We are each irreplaceable.  

A deep dive into the relationship between the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. Some in the Urantia book overlook language that agrees with the Course. 

Why is the CIM so abstract? Does the Urantia book contain abstract concepts? The reason these concepts sound so hard is because they are asking us to consider a reality that is very different from the one we know. It is timeless, spaceless, 

UB: 102:8.7 True religion has nothing to do with alleged miracles, and never does revealed religion point to miracles as proof of authority. Religion is ever and always rooted and grounded in personal experience.
This quote contradicts the CIM. However, it also points out the limitations of personal revelation as opposed to epochal revelation. Jesus speaking to Helen was limited to Helen and Bills use of language. They considered a miracle to be more than the UB use of the term. In fact they saw miracles as a personal religious experience and more. They don’t use the term miracle as purely physical phenomenon. 

What would be the motivations of those who participated in the creation of these two books? Helen and Bill received no compensation from their participation in making the Course in Miracles a reality. Likewise, those involved in the publishing of the Urantia book received little attention or compensation. Both teams took many years to bring these books into being. Neither created a religious empire from them as previous religions did. 

Time and space are temporary constructs engineered for a specific purpose. They have limited value from an eternal perspective. 

Need a timeline in introduction, brief. UB started receiving papers in 1913 from an unknown contact personality who spoke in a trance. Continued until 1934. Published in 1950. Forum to study papers formed in .? Papers claim to be authored by 

Thoughts on CIM statements before time
This sounds like the creator describing the early days of creation when the creators were making decisions on what types of limits to build into the time-space creation. 
Jesus says time and space did not exist before the separation. It sounds like he may be describing the thought process back in the beginning of time. The Urantia book does say the creators built limitations into time and space to limit our free will choices. So maybe Jesus as creator is describing the early days when the creators were devising the limitations necessary to deal with the new realities of extending creation from the eternal to the temporal. 

quote: The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement itself began. The principle was love, and the Atonement itself was an act of love. Acts were not necessary before the separation because the time-space belief did not exist. It was only after the separation that the defense of Atonement and the necessary conditions for its fulfillment were planned.

Eternal point of view
From the eternal point of view, nothing temporal is real. That may seem shocking to students of either book but both state this as a reality. The UB says that to spirit being the material world is almost entirely unreal. The CIM OE entire course is designed to shift from a purely temporal viewpoint to an eternal viewpoint. The temporal is a subset of the eternal. Morontia is more enduring, spirit is the final goal. We created a temporal world with the primary goal to find God and be like him. 

Thrill of creation. 
We have a purpose in this life. We were created to create like the father. The infinite is ever expanding, that is why it never changes. It was created to extend. Nothing ca replace the thrill of creating like the Father. 

How do I attach my security to a faint voice that I can barely detect and not even sure when I’m making up something.

The UB and CIM give us enough information to reverse engineer what makes us up. We can use the intro to conduct experiments. Trial and error based on insights from these two books. 

Summary of objectives of both books....
The Urantia Book is about creating a balanced personality between our divine and human selves to eventually fuse them together as one. A Course in Miracles is the curriculum to deprogram the ego from the error inherent on a confused planet, train your mind to think from a place of pure sincerity so you learn to communicate with your divine self until there is no difference between your mind (thoughts) and God's mind and your desire to do God's will fuses you with your thought adjuster.

Small population back when Jesus was alive 
Back when Jesus was alive the population of earth was around 700 million and few could write. In marketing, first to market usually has an advantage. If someone writes an inspired work today it will probably get swallowed up by the sheer magnitude of material available fir consumption. </Text>

We know from the Urantia book that PERSONALITY (referred to as our WILL in the course) and the Divine Monitor (referred to as the SOUL in the course) work to bridge these two realities into a synthesized version of eternal reality. This synthesized creation is the purpose of time and space and material reality as we know it. The Urantia book calls this creation God the Supreme (referred to as the Sonship in the course). The Sonship will be made whole when all the souls are united as one. The Course tells us we are created in the image of God. Our purpose is to create as God creates. Our goal is to complete the Sonship. 

Beginnings of the Ego
In the temporal world we tend to see things as we experience them. A child thinks of itself as a body based on its lack of spiritual experience. It is purely ego driven and lives wholly in the world of perception. As we grow older, if we are fortunate enough to have religious experiences, we begin to have a more altruistic point of view. We may not be conscious of it but we see a kind of weak connection between each other, giving us an unselfish urge to help each other. This unselfish urge may not 

On normal worlds the ego is taught right perception from it’s visible celestial government. On our world, rebellion and default created an environment where our egos are inflated to such an extent that it impedes our creation. 

Difference between CIM and UB technique 
Jesus voice speaks to Helen in a nonverbal technique. It is somewhat of a mystery as to how this works. As we learn in the UB, Jesus taught his apostles and let them pass on knowledge rather than write down his instructions in his own words. Just as with the apostles, Jesus seems to rely on Helen and Bill to relay his teachings to us. Helen does an amazing job of being Jesus scribe. If you read the notes you realize they were having conversations and relating much personal information. This wealth of information needed to be edited into a book suitable for everyone. This process left much leeway to Bill and Helen when editing the notes.  

Your creations
Each one of us is equally as valuable as any other. No one will be left behind who wants to be a part of this creation. We are all adding to creation. What we are creating is enormous, unfathomable, humongous. What seems like the least of us in this life is not true in the grand creation. We are each irreplaceable.  

A deep dive into the relationship between the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. Some in the Urantia book overlook language that agrees with the Course. 

Why is the CIM so abstract? Does the Urantia book contain abstract concepts? The reason these concepts sound so hard is because they are asking us to consider a reality that is very different from the one we know. It is timeless, spaceless, 

UB: 102:8.7 True religion has nothing to do with alleged miracles, and never does revealed religion point to miracles as proof of authority. Religion is ever and always rooted and grounded in personal experience.
This quote contradicts the CIM. However, it also points out the limitations of personal revelation as opposed to epochal revelation. Jesus speaking to Helen was limited to Helen and Bills use of language. They considered a miracle to be more than the UB use of the term. In fact they saw miracles as a personal religious experience and more. They don’t use the term miracle as purely physical phenomenon. 

What would be the motivations of those who participated in the creation of these two books? Helen and Bill received no compensation from their participation in making the Course in Miracles a reality. Likewise, those involved in the publishing of the Urantia book received little attention or compensation. Both teams took many years to bring these books into being. Neither created a religious empire from them as previous religions did. 

Time and space are temporary constructs engineered for a specific purpose. They have limited value from an eternal perspective. 

Need a timeline in introduction, brief. UB started receiving papers in 1913 from an unknown contact personality who spoke in a trance. Continued until 1934. Published in 1950. Forum to study papers formed in .? Papers claim to be authored by 

Thoughts on CIM statements before time
This sounds like the creator describing the early days of creation when the creators were making decisions on what types of limits to build into the time-space creation. 
Jesus says time and space did not exist before the separation. It sounds like he may be describing the thought process back in the beginning of time. The Urantia book does say the creators built limitations into time and space to limit our free will choices. So maybe Jesus as creator is describing the early days when the creators were devising the limitations necessary to deal with the new realities of extending creation from the eternal to the temporal. 

quote: The Atonement principle was in effect long before the Atonement itself began. The principle was love, and the Atonement itself was an act of love. Acts were not necessary before the separation because the time-space belief did not exist. It was only after the separation that the defense of Atonement and the necessary conditions for its fulfillment were planned.

Eternal point of view
From the eternal point of view, nothing temporal is real. That may seem shocking to students of either book but both state this as a reality. The UB says that to spirit being the material world is almost entirely unreal. The CIM OE entire course is designed to shift from a purely temporal viewpoint to an eternal viewpoint. The temporal is a subset of the eternal. Morontia is more enduring, spirit is the final goal. We created a temporal world with the primary goal to find God and be like him. 

Thrill of creation. 
We have a purpose in this life. We were created to create like the father. The infinite is ever expanding, that is why it never changes. It was created to extend. Nothing ca replace the thrill of creating like the Father. 

How do I attach my security to a faint voice that I can barely detect and not even sure when I’m making up something.

The UB and CIM give us enough information to reverse engineer what makes us up. We can use the intro to conduct experiments. Trial and error based on insights from these two books. 

Summary of objectives of both books....
The Urantia Book is about creating a balanced personality between our divine and human selves to eventually fuse them together as one. A Course in Miracles is the curriculum to deprogram the ego from the error inherent on a confused planet, train your mind to think from a place of pure sincerity so you learn to communicate with your divine self until there is no difference between your mind (thoughts) and God's mind and your desire to do God's will fuses you with your thought adjuster.

Back when Jesus was alive the population of earth was around 700 million and few could write. In marketing, first to market usually has an advantage. If someone writes an inspired work today it will probably get swallowed up by the sheer magnitude of material available fir consumption. </Text>

            <Text>Introduction

This book will compare conceptual models presented in the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles. The Urantia Book was published in 1950 by the Urantia Foundation. A version of The Course in Miracles was first published in 1972 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. However, we will use an earlier version as reference, often referred to as the original edition or the Hugh Lynn Casey edition. Both the Urantia Book and a Course in Miracles have unique histories of origin. Both were compiled and published through very different means. Each has developed its own community. At first glance the two seem to embrace incompatible conceptual models. A deeper look will reveal surprising consistency.
In the beginning of the 19th century Jesus (Michael) approved of a plan to provide us with an expanded revelation of our Heavenly Father in the form of a book. The Urantia Book was written by a wide variety of celestial beings with varied origins and backgrounds. It claims no human authorship.  Neither did Jesus personally author any of the papers in the Urantia book. Instead, Jesus let his celestial family give their testimony.
In 1972 Jesus began a collaboration with Helen Schumann and Bill Thetford on the Course in Miracles. He related lessons learned during his life in the flesh to Bill and Helen. While he did collaborate on the Course in Miracles with Helen, he gave them freedom to edit it as they thought best. Jesus relied on Helen and Bill to deliver his message.
In both books Jesus used the same approach of letting his family do the talking. According to the Urantia book Jesus left no writings behind during his life in the flesh. He knew there was a danger of men turning his words into crystallized dogma. So he left the responsibility to deliver his message to his apostles. We know from the Urantia book that that decision had limited success. The apostles did their best to relate his message to the masses. But even this limited success was preferable to Jesus. Spirit reality is simply beyond description. 

Terminology 

The terminology used in these two books differ significantly. Words can convey multiple meanings. This has been a major obstacle in comparing these two book. Both books point out the limitations of language. 

Course in Miracles OE: Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality.

Urantia Book: 0:12.13 We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of our assignment; we recognize the impossibility of fully translating the language of the concepts of divinity and eternity into the symbols of the language of the finite concepts of the mortal mind. 

The Course takes a more abstract approach in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond description, you can only “know” as a result of religious experience. The Urantia book uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the terms perception and knowledge to designate between temporal and eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal (UB:adjutant) mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe multiple points of view including material and spiritual. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the divine monitor, thought adjuster, father fragment, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term soul to refer to God living within us. In this way the two books use different symantics to relate similar concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly. Each book enhances and expands the other. 

Community

This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this book will open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  
There is no question that the two books were created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how the two books have so much in common. 
This study will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. 
The struggle to understand the CIM in relation to the UB will be worth the effort. Jesus lived his life in the flesh and created a path to our heavenly father that we can follow. He gave us the Urantia book revelation to expand our awareness of our existence. It describes in detail our ascension potential. It describes a process called adjuster fusion that will one day be a common occurrence as an alternative to death. He gave us the Course in Miracles to help us achieve this goal of adjuster fusion and usher in a new age of expanding awareness. 

Urantia:
100:4.2 Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised in behalf of the great, the good, the true, and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual VISION and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving.

The Master Plan
A Peek Beyond The Veil

Many of us know from personal experience that something profound exists apart from our material world. Something we call spirit, God, infinity, eternity, and many other labels that tease our logical minds with mystery and wonder. 
We are experiencing a tug of war within ourselves. Seek and ye shall find may be true in our experience of spirit but we still struggle to translate that experience into language that we can all agree on. This disunity of thought is evident by the number of religions created to explain the mystery of our existence. 
Metaphysics has attempted to unify this gap between the temporal world and the spirit world. But is it possible to reverse engineer our reality from the bottom up? If we define religion as our personal experience with God, can we unite science and religion into a cohesive philosophy for living? 
Theology seems to have reached its limits in its ability to explain spirituality in modern terms. Metaphysics has picked up the mantle of trying to push deeper into the unknown. Science is pushing the envelope on quantum mechanics attempting to reverse engineer material reality. Philosophy continues to evolve its world model and our place in it. Yet today we are being bombarded with more theories of everything. Instead of answers we have disunity of thought. Today is a struggle for a quality of thinking. We need clarity more than ever in this confusing world. 



Jews had scripture that represented their highest concept of mans place in the cosmos. 
Today we have the Bible that represents our best understanding of our place in creation. 
Could it be possible that Jesus approved of an enhanced revelation  that builds on the past revelations? 
Jesus approved of a book that reveals 
It says overmuch revelation is harmful. Time has to pass after each increased revelation of truth. 
What purpose does this life serve? Why were we created. Why is spirit so mysterious? 
How do we gain access to this world of the spirit?  What is the grand plan of  creation? 
Peace seems boring in a world of excitement and riches. We can push the boundaries of our mind by making peace of mind a goal.
Access to intuition




Jesus knew something we still do not know. He knew the master plan. Our world was created to fulfill a purpose. 

The Urantia book says we need additional revelation from time to time to help us move past blocks we would never otherwise move past.

The 20th century 

Miracles in the UB
120:4.5  Urantia mortals have varying concepts of the miraculous, but to us who live as citizens of the local universe there are few miracles, and of these by far the most intriguing are the incarnational bestowals of the Paradise Sons. The appearance in and on your world, by apparently natural processes, of a divine Son, we regard as a miracle — the operation of universal laws beyond our understanding. Jesus of Nazareth was a miraculous person.
.
136:8.2  Jesus very wisely foresaw that the working of miracles and the execution of wonders would call forth only outward allegiance by overawing the material mind; such performances would not reveal God nor save men. He refused to become a mere wonder-worker. He resolved to become occupied with but a single task — the establishment of the kingdom of heaven.


We are being taught by Jesus himself. The Course in Miracles is distilled learning of Jesus while he lived his life in the flesh. He created a path to the father that we all can follow. 


Use this to formulate paragraph about how many religions we have on the planet. 
45 - (103:1.1) The unity of religious experience among a social or racial group derives from the identical nature of the God fragment indwelling the individual. It is this divine in man that gives origin to his unselfish interest in the welfare of other men. But since personality is unique—no two mortals being alike—it inevitably follows that no two human beings can similarly interpret the leadings and urges of the spirit of divinity which lives within their minds. A group of mortals can experience spiritual unity, but they can never attain philosophic uniformity. And this diversity of the interpretation of religious thought and experience is shown by the fact that twentieth-century theologians and philosophers have formulated upward of five hundred different definitions of religion. In reality, every human being defines religion in the terms of his own experiential interpretation of the divine impulses emanating from the God spirit that indwells him, and therefore must such an interpretation be unique and wholly different from the religious philosophy of all other human beings.

Laws of spirit 
We should be able to reduce these to a set of laws of spirit that are repeatable. 


Perception versus Knowledge
Perception versus Knowledge
In the Course in Miracles the ego is the bad guy. Perception is a bad thing. Or so it seems at first glance. The CIM also refers to time as an illusion. If we look a little deeper, we may be surprised at what is being conveyed. 
The Course keeps things pretty simple in that the terminology is used consistently throughout the book. The word PERCEPTION refers to the animal mind, a purely time based view of reality. The animal mind has no clue of spirit reality. The word KNOWLEDGE refers to the eternal perspective. These two realities operate on very different levels. They are at odds with each other. The Course even says these two realities cannot communicate with each other. We know from the Urantia book that PERSONALITY (referred to as our WILL in the course) and the Divine Monitor (referred to as the SOUL in the course) work to bridge these two realities into a synthesized version of eternal reality. This synthesized creation is the purpose of time and space and material reality as we know it. The Urantia book calls this creation God the Supreme (referred to as the Sonship in the course). The Sonship will be made whole when all the souls are united as one. The Course tells us we are created in the image of God. Our purpose is to create as God creates. Our goal is to complete the Sonship. 

Beginnings of the Ego
In the temporal world we tend to see things as we experience them. A child thinks of itself as a body based on its lack of spiritual experience. It is purely ego driven and lives wholly in the world of perception. As we grow older, if we are fortunate enough to have religious experiences, we begin to have a more altruistic point of view.

Too much revelation is not good for the imagination. Discovery is part of the journey. We are at a turning point in history. 

Limits of language
Communication is hard for everyone. The meaning of a word can be perceived differently for many. Culture, environment, and genetics can have an influence on how we interpret meaning. The Bible is a good historical example of how people interpret words in a book to form different ideas. Consider the number of religions formed as a result of the Bible. Some religions claim to be the only real religion. How can so many people read the same words and form different opinions? Perception varies for each individual. Each person forms his/her own model of reality and adjusts it to every other model. No two are exactly alike.

            <Title>Two Books - Revelation (Conflicted Copy)</Title>
            <Text>Two Books
Two Types of Revelation 

We have reached a point of diminishing returns in our attempts to push the boundaries of reality through metaphysics. We are at a dead end. The universe is filled with personalities. The spirit world is reaching out as we cross a tipping point in our history.

We should take advantage of the insights within these two revelations to adjust our approach to spirit as a scientist would apply the scientific process to a purely material venture. Unlike a science experiment, the results of our trials will be more of a qualitative measure. Love cannot be measured but we do experience it in degrees as we move through life. Sincerity is critical if we intend to relate experience to each other. Only personal religious experience will validate the approach these two books take.  UB? Says theology is the psychology of religion. UB defines religion as personal experience, not necessarily today’s organized religion. 
These two books give us a major conceptual upgrade from our current world model. We are told of details that might have taken us thousands of years to discover. We need to use these insights to build a mental model of the world and how we fit into it. One that parallels spirit as closely as possible. The Course in Miracles tells us we have upside down thinking. We are identified too closely to our material ego minds. Had we not veered from the master plan of creation we would have visible celestial leadership to help us progress towards a right side up way of thinking that deemphasizes the ego mind and emphasizes spirit identification. 

These two books introduce quite a bit of complexity that this author can only touch on. In truth, very little of this complexity needs to be understood to press forward and have genuine religious experiences. As the UB says, ones theology may be very inaccurate, yet his religion is true and genuine. We may attach our real and genuine experiences to inaccurate or partial claims of truth, but the experience itself is personal and true and beyond words.  
Forgiveness 
All of our potential of religious experience is blocked by our unwillingness to forgive and assist our human and divine family. Some of us lack motivation to serve others. One reason for all of this complexity within these books is to give purpose and insight to our decision to forgive our human family and attempt to fill the void of gods love in ourselves and each other. An understanding of who we are and our true purpose in this life is helpful to work on removing the blocks in our mind to the higher mind functions built into our being. These two books promise a future beyond our wildest imaginations. An eternal adventure in time and eternity. 

Gives an expanded view of creation, the trinity, 
A top down perspective as well as a bottom up perspective. 
Just as the Jews did not recognize Jesus as a revelation of God, so it is possible the current revelations may be rejected and attacked. Will pride in an established theology evoke a similar response to the revelation of Jesus?
The Course gives most of its attention to our abilities as concerns our practical application of mind, body, and spirit. In this arena the course expands on information given in the Urantia book. For instance, the Urantia book gives a detailed breakdown of where the Holy Spirit fits into the whole of creation. Whereas the Course in Miracles explains how the Holy Spirit works within our being. We are informed of it’s logic, it’s way of “thinking”. It never attacks, never

Neither did Jesus personally author any of the papers in the Urantia book. Instead, Jesus let his celestial family give their testimony.
In 1972 Jesus (Michael) began a collaboration with Helen Schumann and Bill Thetford on the Course in Miracles. He related lessons learned during his life in the flesh to Bill and Helen. While he did collaborate on the Course in Miracles with Helen, he gave them freedom to edit it as they thought best. Jesus relied on Helen and Bill to deliver his message.
In both the Urantia Book and A Course in Miracles Jesus used the same approach of letting his family do the talking. According to the Urantia book Jesus left no writings behind during his life in the flesh. He knew there was a danger of men turning his words into crystallized dogma. So he left the responsibility to deliver his message to his apostles. We know from the Urantia book that that decision had limited success. The apostles did their best to relate his message to the masses. But even this limited success was preferable to Jesus. So in the same way Jesus let various celestial beings relate universal truth to us. Nothing in the UB was written by Jesus directly. Quotes were given of his spoken words only. He took the same approach in the CIM. He communicated to Helen and Bill and let them write, edit, and print their communications to us. He could have magically made a CIM appear in finished form with no human intervention. But he chose to continue his previous decision to be one step removed from any written word. 
Jesus interaction with Bill and Helen may also be a demonstration using words, on how the spirit of truth works within each of us. 

Spirit reality is simply beyond description. 


Terminology 
Communication can be challenging. The meaning of a word can be perceived differently for many. Culture, environment, and genetics can have an influence on how we interpret meaning. The Bible is a good historical example of how people interpret words in a book to form different ideas. Consider the number of religions formed as a result of the Bible. Some religions claim to be the only real religion. How can so many people read the same words and form different opinions? Perception varies for each individual. Each person forms his/her own model of reality and adjusts it to every other model. No two are exactly alike. 

The terminology used in these two books differ significantly. Words can convey multiple meanings. This has been a major obstacle in comparing these two book. Both books point out the limitations of language. 

Course in Miracles OE: Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality.

Urantia Book: 0:12.13 We are fully cognizant of the difficulties of our assignment; we recognize the impossibility of fully translating the language of the concepts of divinity and eternity into the symbols of the language of the finite concepts of the mortal mind. 

The Course takes a more abstract approach in communicating concepts. It also keeps the terms it uses to a minimum. For instance, the word knowledge as referred to in the Course in Miracles refers to a pure spiritual form of knowing based on religious experience that is beyond description, you can only “know” as a result of religious experience. The Urantia book uses the word knowledge to cover a wider spectrum of information, including knowledge ranging from the temporal to the eternal perspectives. Additionally, The Course in Miracles uses the terms perception and knowledge to designate between temporal and eternal points of view. It maintains strict discipline when using these terms. Perception in the Course strictly refers to the animal (UB:adjutant) mind, the egoic mind. The Urantia book uses perception to describe multiple points of view including material and spiritual. The Uranita Book also makes an effort to expand on our use of language by using multiple terms to refer to one concept. For instance, it refers to God living within us as the “divine monitor”, “thought adjuster”, “father fragment”, etc. The Course in Miracles uses only the term “soul” The way the CIM uses the term soul is identical to the UB use of “divine monitor”, “thought adjuster”, “father fragment”. In this way the two books use different symantics to relate similar concepts to us. When viewed side by side the concepts communicated can be seen more clearly. Each book enhances and expands the other. 

Community

We need a community of spiritual regenerators. People who focus totally on spiritual regeneration. This will uplift all people and ultimately lift the nations. The UB says when x number of young people pursue purely material professions, society cannot survive. 


This book is also an attempt to expand on a conversation between two communities, the Course in Miracles community and the Urantia Book community. Both communities seem to be suspicious of the other to some degree. I hope this effort will open a dialog to further the parallel study of each work.  

There is no question that the two books were created by completely separate groups in completely different settings. And yet the concepts communicated in each book compliment each other so thoroughly, it is at least a curiosity as to how they came about in unique ways and have grown separate communities without fully understanding how the two books have so much in common. The study of the two books complementary nature is a rewarding journey and endless discovery. 

This study will consider these two books alone, ruling out all other new age sources of information. I do this not to discredit or minimize other works, but instead to maintain as much clarity as possible. These two books contain enough complexity to sort through. 
Jesus lived his life in the flesh and created a path to our heavenly father that we can follow. He gave us the Urantia book revelation to expand our awareness of our existence. It describes in detail our ascension potential. It describes a process called adjuster fusion that will one day be a common occurrence as an alternative to death. He gave us the Course in Miracles to help us achieve this goal and usher in a new age of expanding awareness. 

100:4.2 Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised in behalf of the great, the good, the true, and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual VISION and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving.
