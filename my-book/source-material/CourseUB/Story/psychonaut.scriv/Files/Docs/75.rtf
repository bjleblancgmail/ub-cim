\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs22\b0\i0\cf1 Scene 9 - Alex dreams of his mission}
\par\plain {\f1\fs22\b0\i0\cf1 Alex will have symbolic dreams where he goes up a mountain and see's visions. Is this Adam dreaming that Jesus would set Adams feet on the ground? Gilgamesh said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91I dreamed again. We stood in a deep gorge of the mountain, and beside it we two were like the smallest of swamp flies; and suddenly the mountain fell, it struck me and caught my feet from under me. Then came an intolerable light blazing out, and in it was one whose grace and whose beauty were greater than the beauty of this world. He pulled me out from under the mountain, he gave me water to drink and my heart was comforted, and he set my feet on the-ground.' UB quote:  "I have given consideration to the circumstances of your default, I have remembered the desire of your hearts ever to be loyal to my Father's will, and you will be called from the embrace of mortal slumber when I come to Urantia if the subordinate Sons of my realm do not send for you before that time."}
\par\plain {\f1\fs22\b0\i0\cf1 Water represents spirit. Water will be part of the theme of the vivid dream. }}
