\par\plain {\f1\fs22\b0\i0\cf1 Alex discovers radio type receivers in the brain, circular in nature. He finds 7 distinct sections that map to 7 adjutants. Spooky Do wants to genetically engineer people so the seventh adjutant does not work. He recreates living structures in the brain that perform specific functions. He integrates them into electronic neural networks. As he progresses in integrating himself into the big brain he learns that thinking as a group (family) or organism works better than thinking whats best for the part. He struggles with the idea of all this power in his hands. Will it corrupt him. His antagonist has been corrupted by a similar technology. He eventually learns how to tap into his own higher consciousness to defeat the bad guy (his own ego and the villain). The bad guy being drunk with power blocks his access to the higher mind functions giving Alex the advantage. }}
